<p><span class="bold">CALHOUN, JOHN CALDWELL<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> (1782-1850), American statesman
and parliamentarian, was born, of Scottish-Irish descent,
in Abbeville District, South Carolina, on the 18th of March 1782.
His father, Patrick Calhoun, is said to have been born in Donegal,
in North Ireland, but to have left Ireland when a mere child.
The family seems to have emigrated first to Pennsylvania,
whence they removed, after Braddock&rsquo;s defeat, to Western
Virginia. From Virginia they removed in 1756 to South Carolina
and settled on Long Cane Creek, in Granville (now Abbeville)
county. Patrick Calhoun attained some prominence in the
colony, serving in the colonial legislature, and afterwards in the
state legislature, and taking part in the War of Independence.
In 1770 he had married Martha Caldwell, the daughter of
another Scottish-Irish settler.</p>

<p>The opportunities for obtaining a liberal education in the
remote districts of South Carolina at that time were scanty.
Fortunately, young Calhoun had the opportunity, although late,
of studying under his brother-in-law, the Rev. Moses Waddell
(1770-1840), a Presbyterian minister, who afterwards, from
1819 to 1829, was president of the University of Georgia. In
1802 Calhoun entered the junior class in Yale College, and
graduated with distinction in 1804. He then studied first at
the famous law school in Litchfield, Conn., and afterwards in a
law office in Charleston, S.C., and in 1807 was admitted to the
bar. He began practice in his native Abbeville District, and
soon took a leading place in his profession. In 1808 and 1809
he was a member of the South Carolina legislature, and from
1811 to 1817 was a member of the national House of Representatives.</p>

<p>When he entered the latter body the strained relations
between Great Britain and the United States formed the most
important question for the deliberation of Congress. Henry
Clay, the Speaker of the House, being eager for war and knowing
Calhoun&rsquo;s hostility to Great Britain, gave him the second place
on the committee of foreign affairs, of which he soon became
the actual head. In less than three weeks the committee
reported resolutions, evidently written by Calhoun, recommending
preparations for a struggle with Great Britain; and in the
following June Calhoun submitted a second report urging a
formal declaration of war. Both sets of resolutions the House
adopted. Clay and Calhoun did more, probably, than any other
two men in Congress to force the reluctant president into
beginning hostilities.</p>

<p>In 1816 Calhoun delivered in favour of a protective tariff a
speech that was ever after held up by his opponents as evidence
of his inconsistency in the tariff controversy. The embargo and
the war had crippled American commerce, but had stimulated
manufactures. With the end of the Napoleonic wars in Europe
the industries of the old world revived, and Americans began to
feel their competition. In the consequent distress in the new
industrial centres there arose a cry for protection. Calhoun,
believing that there was a natural tendency in the United States
towards the development of manufactures, supported the Tariff
Bill of 1816, which laid on certain foreign commodities duties
higher than were necessary for the purposes of revenue. He
believed that the South would share in the general industrial
development, not having perceived as yet that slavery was an
insuperable obstacle. His opposition to protection in later years
resulted from an honest change of convictions. He always
denied that in supporting this bill he had been inconsistent,
and insisted that it was one for revenue.</p>

<p>From 1817 to 1825 Calhoun was secretary of war under
President Monroe. To him is due the fostering and the reformation
of the National Military Academy at West Point, which he
found in disorder, but left in a most efficient state. Calhoun was
vice-president of the United States from 1825 to 1832, during
the administration of John Quincy Adams, and during most of
the first administration of Andrew Jackson. This period was
for Calhoun a time of reflection. His faith in a strong nationalistic
policy was gradually undermined, and he finally became
the foremost champion of particularism and the recognized
leader of what is generally known as the &ldquo;States Rights&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Strict Construction&rdquo; party.</p>

<p>In 1824 there was a very large increase in protective duties.
In 1828 a still higher tariff act, the so-called &ldquo;Bill of Abominations,&rdquo;
was passed, avowedly for the purpose of protection.
The passage of these acts caused great discontent, especially
among the Southern states, which were strictly agricultural.
They felt that the great burden of this increased tariff fell on
them, as they consumed, but did not produce, manufactured
articles. Under such conditions the Southern states questioned
the constitutionality of the imposition. Calhoun himself now
perceived that the North and the South represented diverse
tendencies. The North was outstripping the South in population
and wealth, and already by the tariff acts was, as he believed,
selfishly levying taxes for its sole benefit. The minority must,
he insisted, be protected from &ldquo;the tyranny of the majority.&rdquo;
In his first important political essay, &ldquo;The South Carolina
Exposition,&rdquo; prepared by him in the summer of 1828, he showed
how this should be done. To him it was clear that the Federal
Constitution was a limited instrument, by which the sovereign
states had delegated to the Federal government certain general
powers. The states could not, without violating the constitutional
compact, interfere with the activities of the Federal
government so long as the government confined itself to its
proper sphere; but the attempt of Congress, or any other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span>
department of the Federal government, to exercise any power
which might alter the nature of the instrument would be an act
of usurpation. The right of judging such an infraction belonged
to the state, being an attribute of sovereignty of which the state
could not be deprived without being reduced to a wholly subordinate
condition. As a remedy for such a breach of compact
the state might resort to nullification (<i>q.v.</i>), or, as a last resort,
to secession from the Union. Such doctrines were not original
with Calhoun, but had been held in various parts of the Union
from time to time. It remained for him, however, to submit
them to a rigid analysis and reduce them to a logical form.</p>

<p>Meantime the friendship between Calhoun and Jackson had
come to an end. While a member of President Monroe&rsquo;s cabinet,
Calhoun had favoured the reprimanding of General Jackson (<i>q.v.</i>)
for his high-handed course in Florida in 1818, during the first
Seminole War. In 1831 W.H. Crawford, who had been a member
of this cabinet, desiring to ruin Calhoun politically by turning
Jackson&rsquo;s hostility against him, revealed to Jackson what had
taken place thirteen years before. Jackson could brook no
criticism from one whom he had considered a friend; Calhoun,
moreover, angered the president still further by his evident
sanction of the social proscription of Mrs Eaton (<i>q.v.</i>); the political
views of the two men, furthermore, were becoming more and more
divergent, and the rupture between the two became complete.</p>

<p>The failure of the Jackson administration to reduce the Tariff
of 1828 drew from Calhoun his &ldquo;Address to the People of South
Carolina&rdquo; in 1831, in which he elaborated his views of the nature
of the Union as given in the &ldquo;Exposition.&rdquo; In 1832 a new tariff
act was passed, which removed the &ldquo;abominations&rdquo; of 1828 but
left the principle of protection intact. The people of South
Carolina were not satisfied, and Calhoun in a third political tract,
in the form of a letter to Governor James Hamilton (1786-1857)
of South Carolina, gave his doctrines their final form, but without
altering the fundamental principles that have already been stated.</p>

<p>In 1832 South Carolina, acting in substantial accordance with
Calhoun&rsquo;s theories, &ldquo;nullified&rdquo; the tariff acts passed by Congress
in 1828 and 1832 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Nullification</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">South Carolina</a></span>; and
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">United States</a></span>). On the 28th of December 1832 Calhoun
resigned as vice-president, and on the 4th of January 1833 took
his seat in the Senate. President Jackson had, in a special
message, taken strong ground against the action of South
Carolina, and a bill was introduced to extend the jurisdiction of
the courts of the United States and clothe the president with
additional powers, with the avowed object of meeting the situation
in South Carolina. Calhoun, in turn, introduced resolutions
upholding the doctrine held by South Carolina, and it was
in the debate on the first-named measure, termed the &ldquo;Force
Bill,&rdquo; and on these resolutions, that the first intellectual duel
took place between Daniel Webster and Calhoun. Webster
declared that the Federal government through the Supreme
Court was the ultimate expounder and interpreter of its own
powers, while Calhoun championed the rights of the individual
state under a written contract which reserved to each state its
sovereignty.</p>

<p>The practical result of the conflict over the tariff was a compromise.
Congress passed an act gradually reducing the duties
to a revenue basis, and South Carolina repealed her nullification
measures. As the result of the conflict, Calhoun was greatly
strengthened in his position as the leader of his party in the South.
Southern leaders generally were now beginning to perceive, as
Calhoun had already seen, that there was a permanent conflict
between the North and the South, not only a divergence of
interests between manufacturing and agricultural sections, but an
inevitable struggle between free and slave labour. Should enough
free states be admitted into the Union to destroy the balance of
power, the North would naturally gain a preponderance in the
Senate, as it had in the House, and might, within constitutional
limits, legislate as it pleased. The Southern minority recognized,
therefore, that they must henceforth direct the policy of the
government in all questions affecting their peculiar interests, or
their section would undergo a social and economic revolution.
The Constitution, if strictly interpreted according to Calhoun&rsquo;s
views, would secure this control to the minority, and prevent an
industrial upheaval.</p>

<p>An element of bitterness was now injected into the struggle.
The Northern Abolitionists, to whom no contract or agreement
was sacred that involved the continuance of slavery, regarded the
clauses in the Federal Constitution which maintained the property
rights of the slave-owners as treaties with evil, binding on no one,
and bitterly attacked the slave-holders and the South generally.
Their attacks may be said to have destroyed the moderate party
in that section. Any criticism of their peculiar institution now
came to be highly offensive to Southern leaders, and Calhoun, who
always took the most advanced stand in behalf of Southern rights,
urged (but in vain) that the Senate refuse to receive abolitionist
petitions. He also advocated the exclusion of abolitionist
literature from the mails.</p>

<p>Indeed from 1832 until his death Calhoun may be said to have
devoted his life to the protection of Southern interests. He
became the exponent, the very embodiment, of an idea. It is a
mistake, however, to characterize him as an enemy to the Union.
His contention was that its preservation depended on the recognition
of the rights guaranteed to the states by the Constitution,
and that aggression by one section could only end in disruption.
Secession, he contended, was the only final remedy left to the
weaker. Calhoun was re-elected to the Senate in 1834 and in 1840,
serving until 1843. From 1832 to 1837 he was a man without
a party. He attacked the &ldquo;spoils system&rdquo; inaugurated by
President Jackson, opposed the removal of the government
deposits from the Bank of the United States, and in general was
a severe critic of Jackson&rsquo;s administration. In this period he
usually voted with the Whigs, but in 1837 he went over to the
Democrats and supported the &ldquo;independent treasury&rdquo; scheme
of President Van Buren. He was spoken of for the presidency in
1844, but declined to become a candidate, and was appointed as
secretary of state in the cabinet of President Tyler, serving from
the 1st of April 1844, throughout the remainder of the term, until
the 10th of March 1845. While holding this office he devoted his
energies chiefly to the acquisition of Texas, in order to preserve
the equilibrium between the South and the constantly growing
North. One of his last acts as secretary of state was to send a
despatch, on the 3rd of March 1845, inviting Texas to accept the
terms proposed by Congress. Calhoun was once more elected to
the Senate in 1845. The period of his subsequent service covered
the settlement of the Oregon dispute with Great Britain and the
Mexican War. On the 19th of February 1847 he introduced in
the Senate a series of resolutions concerning the territory about to
be acquired from Mexico, which marked the most advanced stand
as yet taken by the pro-slavery party. The purport of these
resolutions was to deny to Congress the power to prohibit slavery
in the territories and to declare all previous enactments to this
effect unconstitutional.</p>

<p>In 1850 the Union seemed in imminent danger of dissolution.
California was applying for admission to the Union as a state
under a constitution which did not permit slavery. Her admission
with two Senators would have placed the slave-holding
states in the minority. In the midst of the debate on this application
Calhoun died, on the 31st of March 1850, in Washington.</p>

<p>Calhoun is most often compared with Webster and Clay. The
three constitute the trio upon whom the attention of students at
this period naturally rests. Calhoun possessed neither Webster&rsquo;s
brilliant rhetoric nor his easy versatility, but he surpassed him in
the ordered method and logical sequence of his mind. He never
equalled Clay in the latter&rsquo;s magnetism of impulse and inspiration
of affection, but he far surpassed him in clearness and directness
and in tenacity of will. He surpassed them both in the distinctness
with which he saw results, and in the boldness with which he
formulated and followed his conclusions.</p>

<p>Calhoun in person was tall and slender, and in his later years
was emaciated. His features were angular and somewhat harsh,
but with a striking face and very fine eyes of a brilliant dark blue.
To his slaves he was just and kind. He lived the modest,
unassuming life of a country planter when at his home, and at
Washington lived as unostentatiously as possible, consistent with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>3</span>
his public duties and position. His character in other respects
was always of stainless integrity.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALI,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> an inland town of the department of Cauca, Colombia,
South America, about 180 m. S.W. of Bogot√° and 50 m. S.E. of
the port of Buenaventura, on the Rio Cali, a small branch of the
Cauca. Pop. (1906 estimate) 16,000. Cali stands 3327 ft.
above sea-level on the western side of the Cauca valley, one of
the healthiest regions of Colombia. The land-locked character
of this region greatly restricts the city&rsquo;s trade and development;
but it is considered the most important town in the department.
It has a bridge across the Cali, and a number of religious and
public edifices. A railway from Buenaventura will give Cali and
the valley behind it, with which it is connected by over 200 m.
of river navigation, a good outlet on the Pacific coast. Coal

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CALIBRATION,<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> a term primarily signifying the determination
of the &ldquo;calibre&rdquo; or bore of a gun. The word <i>calibre</i> was introduced
through the French from the Italian <i>calibro</i>, together with
other terms of gunnery and warfare, about the 16th century. The
origin of the Italian equivalent appears to be uncertain. It will
readily be understood that the calibre of a gun requires accurate
adjustment to the standard size, and further, that the bore must
be straight and of uniform diameter throughout. The term was
subsequently applied to the accurate measurement and testing of
the bore of any kind of tube, especially those of thermometers.</p>

<p>In modern scientific language, by a natural process of transition,
the term &ldquo;calibration&rdquo; has come to denote the accurate
comparison of any measuring instrument with a standard, and
more particularly the determination of the errors of its scale.
It is seldom possible in the process of manufacture to make an
instrument so perfect that no error can be discovered by the
most delicate tests, and it would rarely be worth while to attempt
to do so even if it were possible. The cost of manufacture would
in many cases be greatly increased without adding materially
to the utility of the apparatus. The scientific method, in all
cases which admit of the subsequent determination and correction
of errors, is to economize time and labour in production by
taking pains in the subsequent verification or calibration.
This process of calibration is particularly important in laboratory
research, where the observer has frequently to make his own
apparatus, and cannot afford the time or outlay required to make
special tools for fine work, but is already provided with apparatus
and methods of accurate testing. For non-scientific purposes
it is generally possible to construct instruments to measure with
sufficient precision without further correction. The present
article will therefore be restricted to the scientific use and
application of methods of accurate testing.</p>

<p><i>General Methods and Principles.</i>&mdash;The process of calibration
of any measuring instrument is frequently divisible into two
parts, which differ greatly in importance in different cases, and
of which one or the other may often be omitted. (1) The determination
of the value of the unit to which the measurements are
referred by comparison with a standard unit of the same kind.
This is often described as the <i>Standardization</i> of the instrument,
or the determination of the <i>Reduction factor</i>. (2) The verification
of the accuracy of the subdivision of the scale of the instrument.
This may be termed calibration of the scale, and does not
necessarily involve the comparison of the instrument with any
independent standard, but merely the verification of the accuracy
of the relative values of its indications. In many cases the
process of calibration adopted consists in the comparison of the
instrument to be tested with a standard over the whole range of
its indications, the relative values of the subdivisions of the
standard itself having been previously tested. In this case the
distinction of two parts in the process is unnecessary, and the
term calibration is for this reason frequently employed to include
both. In some cases it is employed to denote the first part only,
but for greater clearness and convenience of description we shall
restrict the term as far as possible to the second meaning.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The methods of standardization or calibration employed have
much in common even in the cases that appear most diverse. They
are all founded on the axiom that &ldquo;things which are equal to the
same thing are equal to one another.&rdquo; Whether it is a question of
comparing a scale with a standard, or of testing the equality of two
parts of the same scale, the process is essentially one of interchanging
or substituting one for the other, the two things to be compared. In
addition to the things to be tested there is usually required some
form of balance, or comparator, or gauge, by which the equality
may be tested. The simplest of such comparators is the instrument
known as the <i>callipers</i>, from the same root as calibre, which is in
constant use in the workshop for testing equality of linear dimensions,
or uniformity of diameter of tubes or rods. The more complicated
forms of optical comparators or measuring machines with scales and
screw adjustments are essentially similar in principle, being finely
adjustable gauges to which the things to be compared can be successively
fitted. A still simpler and more accurate comparison is
that of volume or capacity, using a given mass of liquid as the gauge
or test of equality, which is the basis of many of the most accurate
and most important methods of calibration. The common
balance for testing equality of mass or weight is so delicate and so
easily tested that the process of calibration may frequently with
advantage be reduced to a series of weighings, as for instance in the
calibration of a burette or measure-glass by weighing the quantities
of mercury required to fill it to different marks. The balance may,
however, be regarded more broadly as the type of a general method
capable of the widest application in accurate testing. It is possible,
for instance, to balance two electromotive forces or two electrical
resistances against each other, or to measure the refractivity of a
gas by balancing it against a column of air adjusted to produce the
same retardation in a beam of light. These &ldquo;equilibrium,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;null,&rdquo; or &ldquo;balance&rdquo; methods of comparison afford the most
accurate measurements, and are generally selected if possible as
the basis of any process of calibration. In spite of the great diversity
in the nature of things to be compared, the fundamental principles
of the methods employed are so essentially similar that it is possible,
for instance, to describe the testing of a set of weights, or the calibration
of an electrical resistance-box, in almost the same terms, and
to represent the calibration correction of a mercury thermometer
or of an ammeter by precisely similar curves.</p>

<p><i>Method of Substitution.</i>&mdash;In comparing two units of the same
kind and of nearly equal magnitude, some variety of the general
method of substitution is invariably adopted. The same method
in a more elaborate form is employed in the calibration of a series
of multiples or submultiples of any unit. The details of the method
depend on the system of subdivision adopted, which is to some
extent a matter of taste. The simplest method of subdivision is
that on the binary scale, proceeding by multiples of 2. With a
pair of submultiples of the smallest denomination and one of each
of the rest, thus 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, &amp;amp;c., each weight or multiple is equal
to the sum of all the smaller weights, which may be substituted for
it, and the small difference, if any, observed. If we call the weights
A, B, C, &amp;c., where each is approximately double the following
weight, and if we write a for observed excess of A over the rest of
the weights, b for that of B over C + D + &amp;c., and so on, the observations
by the method of substitution give the series of equations,</p>

<p class="center ptb1">A &minus; rest = a, B &minus; rest = b, C &minus; rest = c, &amp;c. &emsp;&emsp;(1)</p>

<p class="noind">Subtracting the second from the first, the third from the second,
and so on, we obtain at once the value of each weight in terms of
the preceding, so that all may be expressed in terms of the largest,
which is most conveniently taken as the standard</p>

<p class="center ptb1">B = A/2 + (b &minus; a)/2, C = B/2 + (c &minus; b)2, &amp;c. &emsp;&emsp;(2)</p>

<p>The advantages of this method of subdivision and comparison, in
addition to its extreme simplicity, are (1) that there is only one
possible combination to represent any given weight within the
range of the series; (2) that the least possible number of weights
is required to cover any given range; (3) that the smallest number
of substitutions is required for the complete calibration. These
advantages are important in cases where the accuracy of calibration
is limited by the constancy of the conditions of observation, as in
the case of an electrical resistance-box, but the reverse may be the
case when it is a question of accuracy of estimation by an observer.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases the ease of numeration afforded
by familiarity with the decimal system is the most important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>4</span>
consideration. The most convenient arrangement on the decimal
system for purposes of calibration is to have the units, tens,
hundreds, &amp;c., arranged in groups of four adjusted in the proportion
of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. The relative values of the weights in
each group of four can then be determined by substitution independently
of the others, and the total of each group of four, making
ten times the unit of the group, can be compared with the smallest
weight in the group above. This gives a sufficient number of
equations to determine the errors of all the weights by the method
of substitution in a very simple manner. A number of other equations
can be obtained by combining the different groups in other
ways, and the whole system of equations may then be solved by the
method of least squares; but the equations so obtained are not all
of equal value, and it may be doubted whether any real advantage
is gained in many cases by the multiplication of comparisons, since
it is not possible in this manner to eliminate constant errors or
personal equation, which are generally aggravated by prolonging
the observations. A common arrangement of the weights in each
group on the decimal system is 5, 2, 1, 1, or 5, 2, 2, 1. These do not
admit of the independent calibration of each group by substitution.
The arrangement 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, or 5, 2, 2, 1, 1, permits independent
calibration, but involves a larger number of weights and observations
than the 1, 2, 3, 4, grouping. The arrangement of ten equal weights
in each group, which is adopted in &ldquo;dial&rdquo; resistance-boxes, and in
some forms of chemical balances where the weights are mechanically
applied by turning a handle, presents great advantages in point of
quickness of manipulation and ease of numeration, but the complete
calibration of such an arrangement is tedious, and in the case of a
resistance-box it is difficult to make the necessary connexions. In
all cases where the same total can be made up in a variety of ways,
it is necessary in accurate work to make sure that the same weights
are always used for a given combination, or else to record the actual
weights used on each occasion. In many investigations where time
enters as one of the factors, this is a serious drawback, and it is better
to avoid the more complicated arrangements. The accurate adjustment
of a set of weights is so simple a matter that it is often possible
to neglect the errors of a well-made set, and no calibration is of
any value without the most
scrupulous attention to details
of manipulation, and
particularly to the correction
for the air displaced in comparing
weights of different
materials. Electrical resistances
are much more difficult
to adjust owing to the change
of resistance with temperature,
and the calibration of a
resistance-box can seldom be
neglected on account of the
changes of resistance which
are liable to occur after
adjustment from imperfect annealing. It is also necessary to
remember that the order of accuracy required, and the actual
values of the smaller resistances, depend to some extent on the
method of connexion, and that the box must be calibrated with
due regard to the conditions under which it is to be used. Otherwise
the method of procedure is much the same as in the case of a box
of weights, but it is necessary to pay more attention to the constancy
and uniformity of the temperature conditions of the observing-room.</p>

<p><i>Method of Equal Steps</i>.&mdash;In calibrating a continuous scale divided
into a number of divisions of equal length, such as a metre scale
divided in millimetres, or a thermometer tube divided in degrees
of temperature, or an electrical slide-wire, it is usual to proceed by
a method of equal steps. The simplest method is that known as the
method of Gay Lussac in the calibration of mercurial thermometers
or tubes of small bore. It is essentially a method of substitution
employing a column of mercury of constant volume as the gauge
for comparing the capacities of different parts of the tube. A precisely
similar method, employing a pair of microscopes at a fixed
distance apart as a standard of length, is applicable to the calibration
of a divided scale. The interval to be calibrated is divided into a
whole number of equal steps or sections, the points of division at
which the corrections are to be determined are called <i>points of
calibration.</i></p>

<p><i>Calibration of a Mercury Thermometer</i>.&mdash;To facilitate description,
we will take the case of a fine-bore tube, such as that of a thermometer,
to be calibrated with a thread of mercury. The bore of
such a tube will generally vary considerably even in the best standard
instruments, the tubes of which have been specially drawn
and selected. The correction for inequality of bore may amount
to a quarter or half a degree, and is seldom less than a tenth. In
ordinary chemical thermometers it is usual to make allowance for
variations of bore in graduating the scale, but such instruments
present discontinuities of division, and cannot be used for accurate
work, in which a finely-divided scale of equal parts is essential.
The calibration of a mercury thermometer intended for work of
precision is best effected after it has been sealed. A thread of mercury
of the desired length is separated from the column. The exact
adjustment of the length of the thread requires a little manipulation.
The thermometer is inverted and tapped to make the mercury run
down to the top of the tube, thus collecting a trace of residual gas
at the end of the bulb. By quickly reversing the thermometer the
bubble passes to the neck of the bulb. If the instrument is again
inverted and tapped, the thread will probably break off at the neck
of the bulb, which should be previously cooled or warmed so as to
obtain in this manner, if possible, a thread of the desired length.
If the thread so obtained is too long or not accurate enough, it is
removed to the other end of the tube, and the bulb further warmed
till the mercury reaches some easily recognized division. At this
point the broken thread is rejoined to the mercury column from the
bulb, and a microscopic bubble of gas is condensed which generally
suffices to determine the subsequent breaking of the mercury column
at the same point of the tube. The bulb is then allowed to cool till
the length of the thread above the point of separation is equal to the
desired length, when a slight tap suffices to separate the thread. This
method is difficult to work with short threads owing to deficient
inertia, especially if the tube is very perfectly evacuated. A thread
can always be separated by local heating with a small flame, but
this is dangerous to the thermometer, it is difficult to adjust the
thread exactly to the required length, and the mercury does not run
easily past a point of the tube which has been locally heated in this
manner.</p>

<p>Having separated a thread of the required length, the thermometer
is mounted in a horizontal position on a suitable support,
preferably with a screw adjustment in the direction of its length.
By tilting or tapping the instrument the thread is brought into
position corresponding to the steps of the calibration successively,
and its length in each position is carefully observed with a pair of
reading microscopes fixed at a suitable distance apart. Assuming
that the temperature remains constant, the variations of length
of the thread are inversely as the variations of cross-section of the
tube. If the length of the thread is very nearly equal to one step,
and if the tube is nearly uniform, the average of the observed lengths
of the thread, taking all the steps throughout the interval, is equal
to the length which the thread should have occupied in each position
had the bore been uniform throughout and all the divisions equal.
The error of each step is therefore found by subtracting the average
length from the observed length in each position. Assuming that
the ends of the interval itself are correct, the correction to be applied
at any point of calibration to reduce the readings to a uniform tube
and scale, is found by taking the sum of the errors of the steps up
to the point considered with the sign reversed.</p>

<p>In the preceding example of the method an interval of ten degrees
is taken, divided into ten steps of 1¬∞ each. The distances of the ends
of the thread from the nearest degree divisions are estimated by the
aid of micrometers to the thousandth of a degree. The error of any
one of these readings probably does not exceed half a thousandth,
but they are given to the nearest thousandth only. The excess
length of the thread in each position over the corresponding degree
is obtained by subtracting the second reading from the first. Taking
the average of the numbers in this line, the mean excess-length is
-10.4 thousandths. The error of each step is found by subtracting
this mean from each of the numbers in the previous line. Finally,
the corrections at each degree are obtained by adding up the errors
of the steps and changing the sign. The errors and corrections
are given in thousandths of 1¬∞.</p>

<p><i>Complete Calibration.</i>&mdash;The simple method of Gay Lussac does
very well for short intervals when the number of steps is not excessive,
but it would not be satisfactory for a large range owing to
the accumulation of small errors of estimation, and the variation
of the personal equation. The observer might, for instance, consistently
over-estimate the length of the thread in one half of the
tube, and under-estimate it in the other. The errors near the middle
of the range would probably be large. It is evident that the correction
at the middle point of the interval could be much more accurately
determined by using a thread equal to half the length of the
interval. To minimize the effect of these errors of estimation, it
is usual to employ threads of different lengths in calibrating the
same interval, and to divide up the fundamental interval of the
thermometer into a number of subsidiary sections for the purpose
of calibration, each of these sections being treated as a step in the
calibration of the fundamental interval. The most symmetrical
method of calibrating a section, called by C.E. Guillaume a &ldquo;Complete
Calibration,&rdquo; is to use threads of all possible lengths which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span>
integral multiples of the calibration step. In the example already
given nine different threads were used, and the length of each was
observed in as many positions as possible. Proceeding in this
manner the following numbers were obtained for the excess-length
of each thread in thousandths of a degree in different positions,
starting in each case with the beginning of the thread at 0¬∞, and
moving it on by steps of 1¬∞. The observations in the first column
are the excess-lengths of the thread of 1¬∞ already given in
illustration of the method of Gay Lussac. The other columns
give the corresponding observations with the longer threads.
The simplest and most symmetrical method of solving these
observations, so as to find the errors of each step in
terms of the whole interval, is to obtain the differences of
the steps in pairs by subtracting each observation from the one
above it. This method eliminates the unknown lengths of the
threads, and gives each observation approximately its due weight.
Subtracting the observations in the second line from those in the
first, we obtain a series of numbers, entered in column 1 of the next
table, representing the excess of step (1) over each of the other steps.
The sum of these differences is ten times the error of the first step,
since by hypothesis the sum of the errors of all the steps is zero in
terms of the whole interval. The numbers in the second column
of Table III. are similarly obtained by subtracting the third line
from the second in Table II., each difference being inserted in its
appropriate place in the table. Proceeding in this way we find the
excess of each interval over those which follow it. The table is
completed by a diagonal row of zeros representing the difference of
each step from itself, and by repeating the numbers already found in
symmetrical positions with their signs changed, since the excess of
any step, say 6 over 3, is evidently equal to that of 3 over 6 with the
sign changed. The errors of each step having been found by adding
the columns, and dividing by 10, the corrections at each point of
the calibration are deduced as before.</p>

<p>The advantages of this method are the simplicity and symmetry
of the work of reduction, and the accuracy of the result, which
exceeds that of the Gay Lussac method in consequence of the much
larger number of independent observations. It may be noticed,
for instance, that the correction at point 5 is 27.1 thousandths by
the complete calibration, which is 2 thousandths less than the value
29 obtained by the Gay Lussac method, but agrees well with the
value 27 thousandths obtained by taking only the first and last
observations with the thread of 5¬∞. The disadvantage of the method
lies in the great number of observations required, and in the labour
of adjusting so many different threads to suitable lengths. It is
probable that sufficiently good results may be obtained with much
less trouble by using fewer threads, especially if more care is taken
in the micrometric determination of their errors.</p>

<p>The method adopted for dividing up the fundamental interval
of any thermometer into sections and steps for calibration may be
widely varied, and is necessarily modified in cases where auxiliary
bulbs or &ldquo;ampoules&rdquo; are employed. The Paris mercury-standards,
which read continuously from 0¬∞ to 100¬∞ C., without intermediate
ampoules, were calibrated by Chappuis in five sections of 20¬∞ each,
to determine the corrections at the points 20¬∞, 40¬∞, 60¬∞, 80¬∞, which
may be called the &ldquo;principal points&rdquo; of the calibration, in terms of
the fundamental interval. Each section of 20¬∞ was subsequently
calibrated in steps of 2¬∞, the corrections being at first referred, as in
the example already given, to the mean degree of the section itself,
and being afterwards expressed, by a simple transformation, in terms
of the fundamental interval, by means of the corrections already
found for the ends of the section. Supposing, for instance, that the
corrections at the points 0¬∞ and 10¬∞ of Table III. are not zero, but
C¬∞ and C&prime; respectively, the correction C<span class="su">n</span> at any intermediate point
n will evidently be given by the formula,</p>

<p class="center ptb1">C<span class="su">n</span> = C¬∞ + c<span class="su">n</span> + (C&prime; &minus; C¬∞)n/10&emsp;&emsp;(3)</p>

<p class="noind">where c<span class="su">n</span> is the correction already given in the table.</p>

<p>If the corrections are required to the thousandth
of a degree, it is necessary to tabulate
the results of the calibration at much more
frequent intervals than 2¬∞, since the correction,
even of a good thermometer, may change by
as much as 20 or 30 thousandths in 2¬∞. To
save the labour and difficulty of calibrating
with shorter threads, the corrections at intermediate
points are usually calculated by a
formula of interpolation. This leaves much to
be desired, as the section of a tube often changes
very suddenly and capriciously. It is probable
that the graphic method gives equally good
results with less labour.</p>

<p><i>Slide-Wire.</i>&mdash;The calibration of an electrical
slide-wire into parts of equal resistance is precisely analogous to that
of a capillary tube into parts of equal volume. The Carey Foster
method, employing short steps of equal resistance, effected by transferring
a suitable small resistance from one side of the slide-wire to
the other, is exactly analogous to the Gay Lussac method, and suffers
from the same defect of the accumulation of small errors unless steps
of several different lengths are used. The calibration of a slide-wire,
however, is much less troublesome than that of a thermometer tube
for several reasons. It is easy to obtain a wire uniform to one part in
500 or even less, and the section is not liable to capricious variations.
In all work of precision the slide-wire is supplemented by auxiliary
resistances by which the scale may be indefinitely extended. In
accurate electrical thermometry, for example, the slide-wire itself
would correspond to only 1¬∞, or less, of the whole scale, which is less
than a single step in the calibration of a mercury thermometer,
so that an accuracy of a thousandth of a degree can generally be
obtained without any calibration of the slide-wire. In the rare
cases in which it is necessary to employ a long slide-wire, such as
the cylinder potentiometer of Latimer Clark, the calibration is best
effected by comparison with a standard,
such as a Thomson-Varley slide-box.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Graphic Representation of Results.</i>&mdash;The
results of a calibration are often
best represented by means of a correction
curve, such as that illustrated in
the diagram, which is plotted to represent
the corrections found in Table III.
The abscissa of such a curve is the reading
of the instrument to be corrected.
The ordinate is the correction to be
added to the observed reading to reduce
to a uniform scale. The corrections
are plotted in the figure in terms of the
whole section, taking the correction to
be zero at the beginning and end. As
a matter of fact the corrections at these
points in terms of the fundamental interval
were found to be &minus;29 and &minus;9 thousandths respectively.
The correction curve is transformed to give corrections in terms
of the fundamental interval by ruling a straight line joining the
points +29 and +9 respectively, and reckoning the ordinates
from this line instead of from the base-line. Or the curve may
be replotted with the new ordinates thus obtained. In drawing
the curve from the corrections obtained at the points of
calibration, the exact form of the curve is to some extent a
matter of taste, but the curve should generally be drawn as
smoothly as possible on the assumption that the changes are
gradual and continuous.</p>

<p>The ruling of the straight line across the curve to express the
corrections in terms of the fundamental interval, corresponds to
the first part of the process of calibration mentioned above under
the term &ldquo;Standardization.&rdquo; It effects the reduction of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>6</span>
readings to a common standard, and may be neglected if relative
values only are required. A precisely analogous correction occurs
in the case of electrical instruments. A potentiometer, for
instance, if correctly graduated or calibrated in parts of equal
resistance, will give correct relative values of any differences of
potential within its range if connected to a constant cell to supply
the steady current through the slide-wire. But to determine at
any time the actual value of its readings in volts, it is necessary
to standardize it, or determine its scale-value or reduction-factor,
by comparison with a standard cell.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A very neat use of the calibration curve has been made by
Professor W.A. Rogers in the automatic correction of screws of dividing
machines or lathes. It is possible by the process of grinding, as
applied by Rowland, to make a screw which is practically perfect
in point of uniformity, but even in this case errors may be introduced
by the method of mounting. In the production of divided scales,
and more particularly in the case of optical gratings, it is most important
that the errors should be as small as possible, and should be
automatically corrected during the process of ruling. With this
object a scale is ruled on the machine, and the errors of the uncorrected
screw are determined by calibrating the scale. A metal
template may then be cut out in the form of the calibration-correction
curve on a suitable scale. A lever projecting from the nut
which feeds the carriage or the slide-rest is made to follow the contour
of the template, and to apply the appropriate correction at each
point of the travel, by turning the nut through a small angle on the
screw. A small periodic error of the screw, recurring regularly at each
revolution, may be similarly corrected by means of a suitable cam
or eccentric revolving with the screw and actuating the template.
This kind of error is important in optical gratings, but is difficult to
determine and correct.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Calibration by Comparison with a Standard.</i>&mdash;The commonest
and most generally useful process of calibration is the direct
comparison of the instrument with a standard over the whole
range of its scale. It is necessary that the standard itself should
have been already calibrated, or else that the law of its indications
should be known. A continuous current ammeter, for instance,
can be calibrated, so far as the relative values of its readings are
concerned, by comparison with a tangent galvanometer, since
it is known that the current in this instrument is proportional
to the tangent of the angle of deflection. Similarly an alternating
current ammeter can be calibrated by comparison with an
electrodynamometer, the reading of which varies as the square of the
current. But in either case it is neccessary, in order to obtain
the readings in amperes, to standardize the instrument for some
particular value of the current by comparison with a voltameter,
or in some equivalent manner. Whenever possible, ammeters
and voltmeters are calibrated by comparison of their readings
with those of a potentiometer, the calibration of which can be
reduced to the comparison and adjustment of resistances, which
is the most accurate of electrical measurements. The commoner
kinds of mercury thermometers are generally calibrated and
graduated by comparison with a standard. In many cases this
is the most convenient or even the only possible method. A
mercury thermometer of limited scale reading between 250¬∞ and
400¬∞ C., with gas under high pressure to prevent the separation
of the mercury column, cannot be calibrated on itself, or by
comparison with a mercury standard possessing a fundamental
interval, on account of difficulties of stem exposure and scale.
The only practical method is to compare its readings every few
degrees with those of a platinum thermometer under the conditions
for which it is to be used. This method has the advantage
of combining all the corrections for fundamental interval, &amp;c.,
with the calibration correction in a single curve, except the
correction for variation of zero which must be tested occasionally
at some point of the scale.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALICO<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span>, a general name given to plain cotton cloth. The
word was spelt in various forms, including &ldquo;calicut,&rdquo; which
shows its derivation from the Indian city of Calicut or Kolikod,
a seaport in the presidency of Madras, and one of the chief ports
of intercourse with Europe in the 16th century, where cotton
cloths were made. The name seems to have been applied to
all kinds of cotton cloths imported from the East. In England
it is now applied particularly to grey or bleached cotton cloth
used for domestic purposes, and, generally, to any fairly heavy
cotton cloth without a pattern. In the United States there is a
special application to printed cloth &ldquo;of a coarser quality than
muslin.&rdquo; In England &ldquo;printed calico&rdquo; is a comprehensive term.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CALICUT<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span>, a city of British India, in the Malabar district of
Madras; on the coast, 6 m. N. of Beypur. In 1901 the population
was 76,981, showing an increase of 14% in the decade.
The weaving of cotton, for which the place was at one time so
famous that its name became identified with its <i>calico</i>, is no
longer of any importance. Calicut is of considerable antiquity;
and about the 7th century it had its population largely increased
by the immigration of the Moplahs, a fanatical race of Mahommedans
from Arabia, who entered enthusiastically into commercial
life. The Portuguese traveller Pero de Covilham
(<i>q.v.</i>) visited Calicut in 1487 and described its possibilities for
European trade; and in May 1498 Vasco da Gama, the first
European navigator to reach India, arrived at Calicut. At
that time it was a very flourishing city, and contained several
stately buildings, among which was especially mentioned a
Brahminical temple, not inferior to the largest monastery in
Portugal. Vasco da Gama tried to establish a factory, but he
met with persistent hostility from the local chief (<i>zamorin</i>), and a
similar attempt made by Cabral two years later ended in the
destruction of the factory by the Moplahs. In revenge the
Portuguese bombarded the town, but no further attempt was
made for some years to establish a trading settlement there.
In 1509 the marshal Don Fernando Coutinho made an unsuccessful
attack on the city; and in the following year it was
again assailed by Albuquerque with 3000 troops. On this
occasion the palace was plundered and the town burnt; but
the Portuguese were finally repulsed, and fled to their ships after
heavy loss. In the following year they concluded a peace with
the zamorin and were allowed to build a fortified factory on the
north bank of the Kallayi river, which was however again, and
finally, abandoned in 1525. In 1615 the town was visited by
an English expedition under Captain Keeling, who concluded
a treaty with the zamorin; but it was not until 1664 that an
English trading settlement was established by the East India
Company. The French settlement, which still exists, was
founded in 1698. The town was taken in 1765 by Hyder Ali,
who expelled all the merchants and factors, and destroyed the
cocoa-nut trees, sandal-wood and pepper vines, that the country
reduced to ruin might present no temptation to the cupidity of
Europeans. In 1782 the troops of Hyder were driven from
Calicut by the British; but in 1788 it was taken and destroyed
by his son Tippoo, who carried off the inhabitants to Beypur
and treated them with great cruelty. In the latter part of 1790
the country was occupied by the British; and under the treaty
concluded in 1792, whereby Tippoo was deprived of half his
dominions, Calicut fell to the British. After this event the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>7</span>
inhabitants returned and rebuilt the town, which in 1800 consisted
of 5000 houses.</p>

<p>As the administrative headquarters of the district, Calicut
maintains its historical importance. It is served by the Madras
railway, and is the chief seaport on the Malabar coast, and the
principal exports are coffee, timber and coco-nut products.
There are factories for coffee-cleaning, employing several hundred
hands; for coir-pressing and timber-cutting. The town has a
cotton-mill, a saw-mill, and tile, coffee and oil works. A detachment
of European troops is generally stationed here to overawe
the fanatical Moplahs.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CALIFORNIA<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span>, one of the Pacific Coast states of the United
States of America, physically one of the most remarkable,
economically one of the more independent, and in history and
social life one of the most interesting of the Union. It is bounded
N. by Oregon, E. by Nevada and Arizona, from which last it
is separated by the Colorado river, and S. by the Mexican
province of Lower California. The length of its medial line
N. and S. is about 780 m., its breadth varies from 150 to 350 m.,
and its total area is 158,207 sq. m., of which 2205 are water
surface. In size it ranks second among the states of the
Union. The coast is bold and rugged and with very few good
harbours; San Diego and San Francisco bays being exceptions.
The coast line is more than 1000 m. long. There are eight coast
islands, all of inconsiderable size, and none of them as yet in
any way important.</p>

<p><i>Physiography.</i>&mdash;The physiography of the state is simple;
its main features are few and bold: a mountain fringe along
the ocean, another mountain system along the east border,
between them&mdash;closed in at both ends by their junction&mdash;a
splendid valley of imperial extent, and outside all this a great
area of barren, arid lands, belonging partly to the Great Basin
and partly to the Open Basin region.</p>

<p>Along the Pacific, and some 20-40 m. in width, runs the mass
of the Coast Range, made up of numerous indistinct chains&mdash;most
of which have localized individual names&mdash;that are broken
down into innumerable ridges and spurs, and small valleys
drained by short streams of rapid fall. The range is cut by
numerous fault lines, some of which betray evidence of recent
activity; it is probable that movements along these faults cause
the earthquake tremors to which the region is subject, all of
which seem to be tectonic. The altitudes of the Coast Range
vary from about 2000 to 8000 ft.; in the neighbourhood of San
Francisco Bay the culminating peaks are about 4000 ft. in height
(Mount Diablo, 3856 ft.; Mount St Helena, 4343 ft.), and to
the north and south the elevation of the ranges increases. In
the east part of the state is the magnificent Sierra Nevada,
a great block of the earth&rsquo;s crust, faulted along its eastern side
and tilted up so as to have a gentle back slope to the west and
a steep fault escarpment facing east, the finest mountain system
of the United States. The Sierra proper, from Lassen&rsquo;s Peak to
Tehachapi Pass in Kern county, is about 430 m. long (from
Mt. Shasta in Siskiyou county to Mt. San Jacinto in Riverside
county, more than 600 m.). It narrows to the north and the
altitude declines in the same direction. Far higher and grander
than the Coast Range, the Sierra is much less complicated,
being indeed essentially one chain of great simplicity of structure.
It is only here and there that a double line of principal summits
exists. The slope is everywhere long and gradual on the west,
averaging about 200 ft. to the mile. Precipitous gorges or
canyons often from 2000 to 5000 ft. in depth become a more
and more marked feature of the range as one proceeds northward;
over great portions of it they average probably not more
than 20 m. apart. Where the volcanic formations were spread
uniformly over the flanks of the mountains, the contrast between
the canyons and the plain-like region of gentle slope in which
they have been excavated is especially marked and characteristic.
The eastern slope is very precipitous, due to a great fault which
drops the rocks of the Great Basin region abruptly downward
several thousand feet. Rare passes cross the chain, opening
at the foot of the mountains on the east and the west high on their
flanks, 7000-10,000 ft. above the sea. Between 36¬∞ 20&prime; and 38¬∞
the lowest gap of any kind is above 9000 ft., and the average
height of those actually used is probably not less than 11,000 ft.
The Kearsarge, most used of all, is still higher. Very few in
the entire Sierra are passable by vehicles. Some forty peaks
are catalogued between 5000 and 8000 ft., and there are eleven
above 14,000. The highest portion of the system is between
the parallels of 36¬∞ 30&prime; and 37¬∞ 30&prime;; here the passes are about
12,000 ft. in elevation, and the peaks range from 13,000 ft.
upward, Mount Whitney, 14,502 ft., being the highest summit
of the United States, excluding Alaska. From this peak northward
there is a gradual decline, until at the point where the
Central Pacific crosses in lat. 39¬∞ 20&prime; the elevation is only 7000 ft.</p>

<p>Of the mountain scenery the granite pinnacles and domes of
the highest Sierra opposite Owen&rsquo;s Lake, where there is a drop
eastward into the valley of about 10,000 ft. in 10 m.; the snowy
volcanic cone of Mt Shasta, rising 10,000 ft. above the adjacent
plains; and the lovely valleys of the Coast Range, and the
south fork of the King river&mdash;all these have their charms;
but most beautiful of all is the unique scenery of the Yosemite
Valley (<i>q.v.</i>). Much of the ruggedness and beauty of the
mountains is due to the erosive action of many alpine glaciers
that once existed on the higher summits, and which have left
behind their evidences in valleys and amphitheatres with
towering walls, polished rock-expanses, glacial lakes and meadows
and tumbling waterfalls. Remnants of these glaciers are still
to be seen,&mdash;as notably on Mt. Shasta,&mdash;though shrunk to small
dimensions. Glacial action may be studied well as far south as
36¬∞. The canyons are largely the work of rivers, modified by
glaciers that ran through them after the rivers had formed them.
All of the Sierra lakes and ponds are of glacial origin and there
are some thousands of them. The lower lake line is about 8000
ft.; it is lower to the north than to the south, owing to the different
climate, and the different period of glacial retrogression. Of
these lakes some are fresh, and some&mdash;as those of the north-east
counties&mdash;alkali. The finest of all is Tahoe, 6225 ft. above the
sea, lying between the true Sierras and the Basin Ranges, with
peaks on several sides rising 4000-5000 ft. above it. It is 1500
ft. deep and its waters are of extraordinary purity (containing
only three grains of solid matter to the gallon). Clear Lake,
in the Coast Range, is another beautiful sheet of water. It is
estimated by John Muir that on an average &ldquo;perhaps more than
a mile&rdquo; of degradation took place in the last glacial period;
but with regard to the whole subject of glacial action in California
as in other fields, there is considerable difference of opinion.
The same authority counted 65 small residual glaciers between
36¬∞ 30&prime; and 39¬∞; two-thirds of them lie between 37¬∞ and 38¬∞,
on some of the highest peaks in the district of the San Joaquin,
Merced, Tuolumne and Owen&rsquo;s rivers. They do not descend,
on an average, below 11,000 ft.; the largest of all, on Mt. Shasta,
descends to 9500 ft. above the sea.</p>

<p>Volcanic action has likewise left abundant traces, especially
in the northern half of the range, whereas the evidences of
glacial action are most perfect (though not most abundant)
in the south. Lava covers most of the northern half of the
range, and there are many craters and ash-cones, some recent and
of perfect form. Of these the most remarkable is Mt. Shasta.
In Owen&rsquo;s Valley is a fine group of extinct or dormant volcanoes.</p>

<p>Among the other indications of great geological disturbances
on the Pacific Coast may also be mentioned the earthquakes
to which California like the rest of the coast is liable. From 1850
to 1887 almost 800 were catalogued by Professor E.H. Holden
for California, Oregon and Washington. They occur in all
seasons, scores of slight tremors being recorded every year by
the Weather Bureau; but they are of no importance, and even
of these the number affecting any particular locality is small.
From 1769 to 1887 there were 10 &ldquo;destructive&rdquo; and 24 other
&ldquo;extremely severe&rdquo; shocks according to the Rossi Forel nomenclatural
scale of intensity. In 1812 great destruction was
wrought by an earthquake that affected all the southern part
of the state; in 1865 the region about San Francisco was violently
disturbed; in 1872 the whole Sierra and the state of Nevada
were violently shaken; and in 1906 San Francisco (<i>q.v.</i>) was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>
large part destroyed by a shock that caused great damage elsewhere
in the state.</p>

<p>North of 40¬∞ N. lat. the Coast Range and Sierra systems unite,
forming a country extremely rough. The eastern half of this
area is covered chiefly with volcanic plains, very dry and barren,
lying between precipitous, although not very lofty, ranges;
the western half is magnificently timbered, and toward the coast
excessively wet. Between 35¬∞ and 36¬∞ N. lat. the Sierra at its
southern end turns westward toward the coast as the Tehachapi
Range. The valley is thus closed to the north and south, and
is surrounded by a mountain wall, which is broken down in but
a single place, the gap behind the Golden Gate at San Francisco.
Through this passes the entire drainage of the interior. The
length of the valley is about 450 m., its breadth averages about
40 m. if the lower foothills be included, so that the entire area
is about 18,000 sq. m. The drainage basin measured from
the water-partings of the enclosing mountains is some three
times as great. From the mouth of the Sacramento to Redding,
at the northern head of the valley, the rise is 552 ft. in 192 m.,
and from the mouth of the San Joaquin southward to Kern
lake it is 282 ft. in 260 m.</p>

<p>Two great rivers drain this central basin,&mdash;the San Joaquin,
whose valley comprises more than three-fifths of the entire
basin, and the Sacramento, whose valley comprises the remainder.
The San Joaquin is a very crooked stream flowing through a low
mud-plain, with tule banks; the Sacramento is much less
meandering, and its immediate basin, which is of sandy loam,
is higher and more attractive than that of the San Joaquin.
The eastward flanks of the Coast Range are very scantily forested,
and they furnish not a single stream permanent enough to reach
either the Sacramento or San Joaquin throughout the dry season.
On the eastern side of both rivers are various important tributaries,
fed by the more abundant rains and melting snows of the
western flank of the Sierra; but these streams also shrink
greatly in the dry season. The Feather, emptying into the
Sacramento river about 20 m. N. of the city of Sacramento,
is the most important tributary of the Sacramento river. A
striking feature of the Sacramento system is that for 200 m.
north of the Feather it does not receive a single tributary of
any importance, though walled in by high mountains. Another
peculiar and very general feature of the drainage system of the
state is the presence of numerous so-called river &ldquo;sinks,&rdquo; where
the waters disappear, either directly by evaporation or (as in
Death Valley) after flowing for a time beneath the surface.
These &ldquo;sinks&rdquo; are therefore not the true sinks of limestone
regions. The popular name is applied to Owen&rsquo;s lake, at the
end of Owen&rsquo;s river; to Mono lake, into which flow various
streams rising in the Sierra between Mount Dana and Castle
Peak; and to Death Valley, which contains the &ldquo;sink&rdquo; of the
Amargosa river, and evidently was once an extensive lake,
although now only a mud-flat in ordinary winters, and a dry,
alkaline, desert plain in summer. All these lakes, and the other
mountain lakes before referred to, show by the terraces about
them that the water stood during the glacial period much higher
than it does now. Tulare lake, which with Buena Vista lake
and Kern lake receives the drainage of the southern Sierra,
shows extreme local variations of shore-line, and is generally
believed to have shrunk extremely since 1850, though of this
no adequate proof yet exists. In 1900 it was about 200 sq. m.
in area. In wet seasons it overflows its banks and becomes
greatly extended in area, discharging its surplus waters into the
San Joaquin; but in dry seasons the evaporation is so great
that there is no such discharge. The drainage of Lassen, Siskiyou
and Modoc counties has no outlet to the sea and is collected
in a number of great alkaline lakes.</p>

<p>Finally along the sea below Pt. Conception are fertile coastal
plains of considerable extent, separated from the interior deserts
by various mountain ranges from 5000 to 7000 ft. high, and
with peaks much higher (San Bernardino, 11,600; San Jacinto,
10,800; San Antonio, 10,140). Unlike the northern Sierra,
the ranges of Southern California are broken down in a number
of places. It is over these passes&mdash;Soledad, 2822 ft., Cajon,
San Gorgonio, 2560 ft.&mdash;that the railways cross to the coast.
That part of California which lies to the south and east of the
southern inosculation of the Coast Range and the Sierra comprises
an area of fully 50,000 sq. m., and belongs to the Basin
Range region. For the most part it is excessively dry and
barren. The Mohave desert&mdash;embracing Kern, Los Angeles
and San Bernardino, as also a large part of San Diego, Imperial
and Riverside counties&mdash;belong to the &ldquo;Great Basin,&rdquo; while a
narrow strip along the Colorado river is in the &ldquo;Open Basin
Region.&rdquo; They have no drainage to the sea, save fitfully for
slight areas through the Colorado river. The Mohave desert is
about 2000 ft. above the sea in general altitude. The southern
part of the Great Basin region is vaguely designated the Colorado
desert. In San Diego, Imperial and Riverside counties a number
of creeks or so-called rivers, with beds that are normally dry,
flow centrally toward the desert of Salton Sink or &ldquo;Sea&rdquo;;
this is the lowest part of a large area that is depressed below the
level of the sea,&mdash;at Salton 263 ft., and 287 ft. at the lowest point.
In 1900 the Colorado river (<i>q.v.</i>) was tapped south of the Mexican
boundary for water wherewith to irrigate land in the Imperial
Valley along the Southern Pacific railway, adjoining Salton Sea.
The river enlarged the canal, and finding a steeper gradient than
that to its mouth, was diverted into the Colorado desert, flooding
Salton Sea;<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and when the break in this river was closed for
the second time in February 1907, though much of its water
still escaped through minor channels and by seepage, a lake
more than 400 sq. m. in area was left. A permanent 60 ft.
masonry dam was completed in July 1907. The region to the
east of the Sierra, likewise in the Great Basin province, between
the crest of that range and the Nevada boundary, is very mountainous.
Owen&rsquo;s river runs through it from north to south for
some 180 m. Near Owen&rsquo;s lake the scenery is extremely grand.
The valley here is very narrow, and on either side the mountains
rise from 7000 to 10,000 ft. above the lake and river. The Inyo
range, on the east, is quite bare of timber, and its summits are
only occasionally whitened with snow for a few days during the
winter, as almost all precipitation is cut off by the higher ranges
to the westward. Still further to the east some 40 m. from the
lake is Death Valley (including Lost or Mesquite Valley)&mdash;the
name a reminder of the fate of a party of &ldquo;forty-niners&rdquo; who
perished here, by thirst or by starvation and exposure. Death
Valley, some 50 m. long and on an average 20-25 m. broad from
the crests of the inclosing mountain ranges (or 5-10 m. at their
base), constitutes an independent drainage basin. It is below
sea level (about 276 ft. according to recent surveys), and altogether
is one of the most remarkable physical features of California.
The mountains about it are high and bare and brilliant with
varied colours. The Amargosa river, entering the valley from
Nevada, disappears in the salty basin. Enormous quantities
of borax, already exploited, and of nitrate of soda, are known
to be present in the surrounding country, the former as almost
pure borate of lime in Tertiary lake sediments.</p>

<p>The physiography of the state is the evident determinant of
its climate, fauna and flora. California has the highest land
and the lowest land of the United States, the greatest variety
of temperature and rainfall, and of products of the soil.</p>

<div class="center pt2"><img style="width:850px; height:652px" src="images/img8a.jpg" alt="" />

<a href="images/img8b1.jpg">(Click to enlarge bottom section.)</a></p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The climate is very different from that of the
Atlantic coast; and indeed very different from that of any part
of the country save that bordering California. Amid great
variations of local weather there are some peculiar features that
obtain all over the state. In the first place, the climate of the
entire Pacific Coast is milder and more uniform in temperature
than that of the states in corresponding latitude east of the
mountains. Thus we have to go north as far as Sitka in 57¬∞ N.
lat. to find the same mean yearly temperature as that of Halifax,
Nova Scotia, in latitude 44¬∞ 39&prime;. And going south along the
coast, we find the mean temperature of San Diego 6¬∞ or 7¬∞ less
than that of Vicksburg, Miss., or Charleston, S.C. The quantity
of total annual heat supply at Puget Sound exceeds that at
Philadelphia, Pittsburg, Cleveland or Omaha, all more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span>
500 m. farther south; Cape Flattery, exposed the year round
to cold ocean fogs, receives more heat than Eastport, Maine,
which is 3¬∞ farther south and has a warmer summer. In the
second place, the means of winter and summer are much nearer
the mean of the year in California than in the east. This condition
of things is not so marked as one goes inward from the
coast; yet everywhere save in the high mountains the winters
are comparatively mild. In the third place, the division of the
year into two seasons&mdash;a wet one and a dry (and extremely
dusty) one&mdash;marks this portion of the Pacific Coast in the most
decided manner, and this natural climatic area coincides almost
exactly in its extension with that of California; being truly
characteristic neither of Lower California nor of the greater part
of Oregon, though more so of Nevada and Arizona. And finally,
in the fourth place, except on the coast the disagreeableness of
the heat of summer is greatly lessened by the dryness of the air
and the consequent rapidity of evaporation. Among the
peculiarities of Californian climate it is not one of the least
striking that as one leaves the Sacramento or San Joaquin plains
and travels into the mountains it becomes warmer, at least for
the first 2000 or 3000 ft. of ascent.</p>

<p>Along both the Coast Range and the Sierra considerable
rainfall is certain, although, owing to the slight snow accumulations
of the former, its streams are decidedly variable. A heavy
rain-belt, with a normal fall of more than 40 in., covers all the
northern half of the Sierra and the north-west counties; shading
off from this is the region of 10-20 in. fall, which covers all the
rest of the state save Inyo, Kern and San Bernardino counties,
Imperial county and the eastern portion of Riverside county;
the precipitation of this belt is from 0 to 10 in. In excessively
dry years the limits of this last division may include all of the
state below Fresno and the entire Central Valley as well. In
the mountains the precipitation increases with the altitude;
above 6000 or 7000 ft. it is almost wholly in the form of snow;
and this snow, melting in summer, is of immense importance to
the state, supplying water once for placer mining and now for
irrigation. The north-west counties are extremely wet; many
localities here have normal rainfalls of 60-70 in. and even higher
annually, while in extreme seasons as much as 125 in. falls.
Along the entire Pacific Coast, but particularly N. of San Francisco,
there is a night fog from May to September. It extends
but a few miles inland, but within this belt is virtually a
prolongation of the rainy season and has a marked effect on
vegetation. Below San Francisco the precipitation decreases
along the coast, until at San Diego it is only about 10 in. The
south-east counties are the driest portions of the United States.
At Ogilby, Volcano, Indio and other stations on the Southern
Pacific line the normal annual precipitation is from 1.5 to 2.5 in.;
and there are localities near Owen&rsquo;s lake, even on its very edge,
that are almost dry. For days in succession when it storms
along the Southern California coasts and dense rain clouds blow
landwards to the mountains, leaving snow or rain on their
summits, it has been observed that within a few miles beyond
the ridge the contact of the desert air dissipates the remaining
moisture of the clouds into light misty masses, like a steam
escape in cold air. The extreme heat of the south-east is tempered
by the extremely low humidity characteristic of the Great Basin,
which in the interior of the two southernmost counties is very
low. The humidity of places such as Fresno, Sacramento and
Red Bluff in the valley varies from 48 to 58. Many places in
northern, southern, central, mountain and southern coastal
California normally have more than 200 perfectly clear days in a
year; and many in the mountains and in the south, even on the
coast, have more than 250. The extreme variability in the
amount of rainfall is remarkable.<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The effects of a season of
drought on the dry portions of the state need not be adverted
to; and as there is no rain or snow of any consequence
on the mountains during summer, a succession of dry
seasons may almost bare the ranges of the accumulated stock
of previous winter snows, thus making worse what is already bad.</p>

<p>The Colorado desert (together with the lower Gila Valley
of Arizona) is the hottest part of the United States. Along the
line of the Southern Pacific the yearly extreme is frequently
from 124¬∞ to 129¬∞ F. (<i>i.e.</i> in the shade, which is almost if not
quite the greatest heat ever actually recorded in any part of the
world). At the other extreme, temperatures of -20¬∞ to -36¬∞
are recorded yearly on the Central (Southern) Pacific line near
Lake Tahoe. The normal annual means of the coldest localities
of the state are from 37¬∞ to 44¬∞ F.; the monthly means from
20¬∞ to 65¬∞ F. The normal annual means on Indio, Mammoth
Tanks, Salton and Volcano Springs are from 73.9¬∞ to 78.4 F.; the
monthly means from 52.8¬∞ to 101.3¬∞ (frequently 95¬∞ to 98¬∞).
The normal trend of the annual isotherms of the state is very
simple: a low line of about 40¬∞ circles the angle in the Nevada
boundary line; 50¬∞ normally follows the northern Sierra across
the Oregon border; lines of higher temperature enclose the
Great Valley; and lines of still higher temperature&mdash;usually
60¬∞ to 70¬∞, in hotter years 60¬∞ to 75¬∞&mdash;run transversely across
the southern quarter of the state.</p>

<p>Another weather factor is the winds, which are extremely
regular in their movements. There are brisk diurnal sea-breezes,
and seasonal trades and counter-trades. Along the coast an
on-shore breeze blows every summer day; in the evening it is
replaced by a night-fog, and the cooler air draws down the
mountain sides in opposition to its movement during the day.
In the upper air a dry off-shore wind from the Rocky Mountain
plateau prevails throughout the summer; and in winter an on-shore
rain wind. The last is the counter-trade, the all-year
wind of Alaska and Oregon; it prevails in winter even off
Southern California.</p>

<p>There is the widest and most startling variety of local climates.
At Truckee, for example, lying about 5800 ft. above the sea near
Lake Tahoe, the lowest temperature of the year may be -25¬∞ F.
or colder, when 70 m. westward at Rocklin, which lies in the
foothills about 250 ft. above the sea, the mercury does not
fall below 28¬∞. Snow never falls at Rocklin, but falls in large
quantity at Truckee; ice is the crop of the one, oranges of the
other, at the same time. There are points in Southern California
where one may actually look from sea to desert and from snow
to orange groves. Distance from the ocean, situation with
reference to the mountain ranges, and altitude are all important
determinants of these climatic differences; but of these the
last seems to be most important. At any rate it may be said
that generally speaking the maximum, minimum and mean
temperatures of points of approximately equal altitude are
respectively but slightly different in northern or southern
California.<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>Death Valley surpasses for combined heat and aridity any
meteorological stations on earth where regular observations
are taken, although for extremes of heat it is exceeded by places
in the Colorado desert. The minimum daily temperature in
summer is rarely below 70¬∞ F. and often above 90¬∞ F. (in the
shade), while the maximum may for days in succession be
as high as 120¬∞ F. A record of 6 months (1891) showed an
average daily relative humidity of 30.6 in the morning and 15.6
in the evening, and the humidity sometimes falls to 5. Yet
the surrounding country is not devoid of vegetation. The hills
are very fertile when irrigated, and the wet season develops
a variety of perennial herbs, shrubs and annuals.</p>

<p><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;California embraces areas of every life-zone of
North America: of the boreal, the Hudsonian and Canadian
subzones; of the transition, the humid Pacific subzone; of
the upper austral, the arid or upper Sonoran subzone; of the
lower austral, the arid or lower Sonoran; of the tropical, the
&ldquo;dilute arid&rdquo; subzone. As will be inferred from the above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span>
account of temperature, summer is longer in the north, and
localities in the Valley have more hours of heat than do those
of south California. Hence that climatic characteristic of
the entire Pacific Coast&mdash;already referred to and which is of
extreme importance in determining the life-zones of California&mdash;the
great amount of total annual heat supply at comparatively
high latitudes. A low summer temperature enables northern
species to push far southward, while the high heat total of the
year enables southern species to push far north. The resultant
intermingling of forms is very marked and characteristic of
the Pacific Coast states. The distribution of life-zones is
primarily a matter of altitude and corresponds to that of the
isotherms. The mountain goat and mountain sheep live in
the Sierran upper-land, though long ago well-nigh exterminated.
The Douglas red squirrel is ubiquitous in the Sierran forests
and their most conspicuous inhabitant. White-tailed deer
and especially black-tails are found on the high Sierra; the
mule deer, too, although its habitat is now mainly east of the
range, on the plateau, is also met with. Grizzly, black, cinnamon
and brown bears are all Californian species once common and
to-day rare. When Americans began to rule in California elk
and antelope herded in great numbers in the Great Valley;
the former may to-day sometimes be seen, possibly, in the
northern forests, and the latter occasionally cross into the state
from Nevada. The sage-hen is abundant on the eastern flank
of the Sierra. Grouse, quail, crows and woodpeckers (<i>Melanerpes
formicivorus</i>) furnish species characteristic of the state. There
are various species of ground-squirrels and gophers, which are
very abundant. Noteworthy in the animal life of the lower
Sonoran and tropic region are a variety of snakes and lizards,
desert rats and mice; and, among birds, the cactus wren, desert
thrasher, desert sparrow, Texas night-hawk, mocking-bird
and ground cuckoo or road runner (<i>Geococcyx Californianus</i>).
The California vulture, the largest flying bird in North America
and fully as large as the Andean condor, is not limited to California
but is fairly common there. In the zoology and botany
of California as of the rest of the Pacific Coast, the distinctions
between the upper austral and humid transition zones are largely
obliterated; and as one passes southward into the arid lands,
life forms of both these zones intermingle with those of the
arid transition.</p>

<p>Fish are abundant. The United States fish commission, and an
active state commission established in 1869, have done much to
preserve and increase this source of food. In 1904 the yield of
the fisheries of the three Pacific Coast states was 168,600,000
lbs, valued at $6,681,000,&mdash;nearly half that of the New England
states, more than one-third that of the Middle Atlantic states and
more than that of the South Atlantic and Gulf states combined.
Of the total, California yielded between a quarter and a third.
A third of her fish comes from the Sacramento river. Some 230&mdash;more
or less&mdash;marine food fishes are to be found in the market at
San Francisco. The exports of fish from that port from 1892-1899
were valued at from $2,000,000 to $2,500,000 annually.
Native oysters are small and of peculiar flavour; eastern
varieties also are fattened, but not bred in California waters.
Shrimp are abundant; the shrimp fishers are Chinese and four-fifths
of the catch is exported to China. Sturgeon were once the
cheapest fish after salmon; to-day, despite all efforts to increase
the supply, they are the dearest. Salmon, once threatened with
extinction, have been saved, maintained in good supply, and
indeed have probably regained their pristine abundance. Shad
and striped bass are both very abundant and cheap. Black bass,
flounders, terrapin, sea-turtles, perch, turbot, sole and catfish are
also common. Great herds of seals once lay like toll-gatherers off
the Golden Gate and other bays of the coast, taking a large share
of the salmon and other fish; but they are no longer common.
The sea-lions sometimes raid the rivers for 100 m. inland. They
have greatly increased since hunting them for their hides and oil
ceased to be profitable, and thousands sometimes gather on the
Farallones, off the Golden Gate.</p>

<p><i>Flora.</i>&mdash;Inclusiveness of range in the distribution of vegetable
life is perhaps more suggestive than the distribution of animal
species. The variation is from dwarf mountain pine to giant
cactus and dates. The humid transition belt is the habitat of
California&rsquo;s magnificent forests. Nut pine, juniper and true
sage-brush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>) characterize the upper
Sonoran,&mdash;although the latter grows equally in the transition zone.
Cereals, orchard fruits and alfalfa are of primary importance in
the upper and of secondary importance in the lower Sonoran. In
the arid portions of this and the tropic areas the indigenous plants
are creosote, mesquite and alfileria bushes, desert acacias,
paloverdes, alkali-heath, salt grass, agaves, yuccas (especially the
Spanish-bayonet and Joshua tree) and cactuses. Among exotics
the Australian saltbush spreads successfully over the worst alkali
land. The introduction of other exotics into these zones,&mdash;made
humid by irrigation, which converts them, the one into true
austro-riparian the other into true humid tropical,&mdash;has
revolutionized the agricultural, and indeed the whole, economy of
California. At the two ends of Cajon Pass, only four or five
kilometres apart, are the two utterly distinct floras of the Mohave
desert and the San Bernardino valley. Despite the presence of
the pass, plants do not spread, so great is the difference of climatic
conditions. On the desert the same plant will vary in different
years from 4 in. to 10 ft. in height when equally mature, according
to the rainfall and other conditions of growth. Many mature
plants are not taller than 0.4 to 0.8 in. The tree yucca often
attains a height of 20 to 25 ft., and a diameter of 1.5 ft. About
600 species of plants were catalogued in desert California in 1891
by a government botanical party. The flora of the coast islands
of California is very interesting. On Santa Cruz Professor Joseph
Le Conte found 248 species, nearly all of which are distinctively
Californian, 48 being peculiar to the surrounding islands and 28
peculiar to Southern California. Various other things indicate a
separation of the islands from the mainland in quaternary times;
since which, owing to the later southward movement on the
continent of northern forms in glacial times, there has been a
struggle for existence on the mainland from which the islands
have largely escaped.</p>

<p><i>Forests.</i>&mdash;The forests and agricultural crops of the state
demand particular notice. In 1900 the woodland was estimated
by the United States census at 22% of the state&rsquo;s area, and the
total stand at 200,000 million ft. of timber. The variety of forest
trees is not great, but some of the California trees are unique, and
the forests of the state are, with those of Oregon and Washington,
perhaps the most magnificent of the world. At least the coniferous
forests which make up nine-tenths of California&rsquo;s woodland
surpass all others known in number of species and in the size and
beauty of the trees. Forty-six species occur, namely, 32 species
of pitch trees (18 pines), 12 species of the cypresses and their
allies (2 sequoia), and 2 species of yews or their allies. Peculiar
to California are the two species of sequoia (<i>q.v.</i>),&mdash;the redwood
(<i>S. sempervirens</i>), and the big-tree (<i>S. gigantea</i>), remnants
of an earlier age when they were common in other parts of the world.
The redwood grows only in a narrow strip on the Coast Range
from Southern Oregon (where there are not more than 1000 acres)
down nearly to the Golden Gate, in a habitat of heavy rains and
heavy fogs. They cover an area of about 2000 sq. m. almost
unmixed with other species. One fine grove stands S. of San
Francisco near Santa Cruz. These noble trees attain very often
a height of more than 300 ft., frequently of 350 and even more,
and a butt diameter of more than 15 to 20 ft., with clean, straight
fluted trunks rising 200 ft. below the lowest branches. They grow
in a very dense timber stand; single acres have yielded
1,500,000 ft. B.M. of lumber, and single trees have cut as high as
100,000 ft. The total stand in 1900 was estimated by the United
States census as 75,000,000,000 ft., and the ordinary stand per
acre varies from 25,000 to 150,000 ft., averaging probably 60,000
ft. The redwood is being rapidly used for lumber. There is
nowhere any considerable young growth from seed, although this
mode of reproduction is not (as often stated) unknown; the tree
will reproduce itself more than once from the stump (hence its
name). In thirty years a tree has been known to grow to a height
of 80 ft. and a diameter of 16 in. The wood contains no pitch and
much water, and in a green condition will not burn. To this fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>
it owes its immunity from the forest fires which wreak frightful
havoc among the surrounding forests. As the redwood is limited
to the Coast Range, so the big tree is limited wholly to the Sierra
Nevada. Unlike the redwood the big tree occurs in scattered
groves (ten in all) among other species. Its habitat extends
some 200 m., from latitude 36¬∞ to 39¬∞, nowhere descending much
below an altitude of 5000 ft., nor rising above 8000 ft. The most
northerly grove and the nearest to San Francisco is the Calaveras
Grove near Stockton; the Mariposa Grove just south of the Yosemite
National Park, is a state reservation and easily accessible
to tourists. The noblest groves are near Visalia, and are held as
a national park. The average height is about 275 ft., and the
diameter near the ground 20 ft.; various individuals stand over
300 ft., and a diameter of 25 ft. is not rare. One tree measures
35.7 ft. inside the bark 4 ft. above the ground, 10 ft. at 200 ft.
above the ground, and is 325 ft. tall. Specimens have been cut
down that were estimated to be 1300 and even 2200 years old;
many trees standing are presumably 2500 years old. It is the
opinion of John Muir that the big tree would normally live 5000
years or more; that the California groves are still in their prime;
that, contrary to general ideas, the big tree was never more widely
distributed than now, at least not within the past 8000 or 10,000
years; that it is not a decaying species, but that on the contrary
&ldquo;no tree of all the forest is more enduringly established in concord
with climate and soil,&rdquo; growing like the mountain pine even
on granite, and in little danger save from the greed of the lumberman;
but other excellent authorities consider it as hardly holding
its own, especially in the north. Three main wood belts cover
the flanks of the Sierra: the lower or main pine belt, the silver fir
belt, and the upper pine belt. The sugar pine, the yellow or silver
pine and the Douglas spruce (considerably smaller than in Oregon
and Washington), are rivals in stature and nobility, all attaining
200 ft. or more when full grown; and the incense cedar reaches a
height of 150 ft. In this belt and the following one of firs the big
tree also grows. The white silver fir (<i>abies concolor</i>) and the silver
or red fir (<i>ab. magnifica</i>), standing 200 to 250 ft., make up almost
wholly the main forest belt from 5000 to 9000 ft. for some 450 m.
Above the firs come the tamarack, constituting the bulk of the
lower Alpine forest; the hardy long-lived mountain pine; the
red cedar or juniper, growing even on the baldest rocks; the
beautiful hemlock spruce; the still higher white pine, nut pine,
needle pine; and finally, at 10,000 to 12,000 ft., the dwarf pine,
which grows in a tangle on the earth over which one walks, and
may not show for a century&rsquo;s growth more than a foot of height
or an inch of girth. The Nevada slope of the mountains below 7500
ft. is covered with the nut pine down to the sage plains. Its nuts
are gathered in enormous amounts by the Indians for food; and
it is estimated that the yearly harvest of these nuts exceeds in
bulk that of all the cereals of California (John Muir). On the
Sierra the underbrush is characterized by the pungent manzanita,
the California buckeye and the chamiso; the last two growing
equally abundantly on the Coast Range. The chamiso and the
manzanita, with a variety of shrubby oaks and thorny plants,
often grow together in a dense and sometimes quite impenetrable
undergrowth, forming what is known as &ldquo;chaparral&rdquo;; if the
chamiso occurs alone the thicket is a &ldquo;chamisal.&rdquo; The elm, the
hickory, the beech, the chestnut, and many others of the most
characteristic and useful trees of the eastern states were originally
entirely wanting in California. Oaks are abundant; they are
especially characteristic of the Great Valley, where they grow in
magnificent groves. Up to 1910 national forest reserves amounted
to 27,968,510 acres. In 1909 Congress created a national forest
to include the big tree groves in Calaveras and Tuolumne counties.
One of the noblest redwood areas (that of Santa Cruz county) is
a state reservation (created in 1901). Even within reservations
almost all the merchantable timber is owned by private individuals.
In addition to native trees many others&mdash;especially
ornamental species&mdash;have been successfully introduced from
various parts of the world.</p>

<p><i>Soil.</i>&mdash;Sand and loams in great variety, grading from mere
sand to adobe, make up the soils of the state. The plains of
the north-east counties are volcanic, and those of the south-east
sandy. It is impossible to say with accuracy what part of the
state may properly be classed as tillable. The total farm acreage
in 1900 was 28,828,951 acres, of which 41.5% were improved;
since 1880 the absolute amount of improved land has remained
practically constant, despite the extraordinary progress of the
state in these years. Much land is too rough, too elevated
or too arid ever to be made agriculturally available; but irrigation,
and the work of the state and national agricultural bureaus
in introducing new plants and promoting scientific farming,
have accomplished much that once seemed impossible. The
peculiarities of the climate, especially its division into two
seasons, make Californian (and Southern Arizona) agriculture
very different from that of the rest of the country. During the
winter no shelter is necessary for live-stock, nor, during summer,
for the grains that are harvested in June and July, and may lie
for weeks or months in the field. The mild, wet winter is the
season of planting and growth, and so throughout the year there
is a succession of crops. The dangers of drought in the long dry
seasons particularly increase the uncertainties of agriculture in
regions naturally arid. Irrigation was introduced in Southern
California before 1780, but its use was desultory and its spread
slow till after 1850. In 1900 almost 1,500,000 acres were irrigated&mdash;an
increase of 46% since 1890. About half of this total was
in San Joaquin Valley. California has the greatest area of
irrigated land of any state in the Union, and offers the most
complete utilization of resources. In the south artesian wells,
and in the Great Valley the rivers of the Sierra slope, are the
main source of water-supply. On nearly all lands irrigated
some crops will grow in ordinary seasons without irrigation, but
it is this that makes possible selection of crops; practically
indispensable for all field and orchard culture in the south,
save for a few moist coastal areas, it everywhere increases the
yield of all crops and is practised generally all over the state.
Of the acreage devoted to alfalfa in 1899, 76.2% was irrigated;
of that devoted to subtropical fruits, 71.7%. Small fruits,
orchard fruits, hay, garden products and grains are decreasingly
dependent on irrigation; wheat, which was once California&rsquo;s
great staple, is (for good, but not for best results) comparatively
independent of it,&mdash;hence its early predominance in Californian
agriculture, due to this success on arid lands since taken over
for more remunerative irrigated crops.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The spread of irrigation and of intensive cultivation,
and the increase of small farms during the last quarter of
the 19th century, have made California what it is to-day. Agriculture
had its beginning in wheat-raising on great ranches,
from 50,000 even to several hundred thousand acres in extent.
A few of these, particularly in the Great Valley, are still worked,
but only a few. The average size of farms in 1850 (when the
large Mexican grants were almost the only farms, and these
unbroken) was 4466 acres; in 1860 it was 466.4, and in 1900
only 397.4 acres. Stock ranches, tobacco plantations, and hay
and grain farms, average from 800 to 530 acres, and counteract
the tendency of dairy farms, beet plantations, orchards, vegetable
gardens and nurseries to lower the size of the farm unit still
further. The renting of large holdings prevails to a greater
extent than in any other state except Texas. From 1880 to
1900 the number of farms above 500 and below 1000 acres
doubled; half of the total in 1900 were smaller than 100 acres.
The most remunerative and most characteristic farming to-day
is diversified and intensive and on small holdings. The essential
character of California&rsquo;s economic life has been determined
by the successive predominance of grass, gold, grain and fruits.
Omitting the second it may be truly said that the order of
agricultural development has been mainly one of blind experiment
or fortuitous circumstances. Staple products have changed
with increasing knowledge of climatic conditions, of life-zones
and of the fitness of crops; first hides and tallow, then wool,
wheat, grapes (which in the early eighteen-nineties were the
leading fruit), deciduous orchard fruits, and semi-tropical citrus
fruits successively. Prunes were introduced in 1854, but their
possibilities were only slightly appreciated for some thirty years.
Of various other crops much the same is true. Of late years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>
progress has been very intelligent; in earlier years it was gained
through a multitude of experiments and failures, and great
pecuniary loss, and progress was a testimonial chiefly to courage
and perseverance. The possibilities of the lower Sonoran and
tropical areas are still imperfectly known. Nature has been
niggard of rain but lavish in soil and sun. Irrigation has shown
that with water, arid and barren plains, veritable deserts may
be made to bloom with immense wealth of semi-tropical fruits;
and irrigation in the tropical area along the Colorado river,
which is so arid that it naturally bears only desert vegetation,
has made it a true humid-tropical region like Southern Florida,
growing true tropical fruits.</p>

<p>In 1900 California ranked eleventh among the states in total
value of farm property ($796,527,955) and in 1899 fourteenth
in the value of farm products ($131,690,606). The growth of
the former from 1890 to 1900 was only 2.5%, one of the
smallest increases among all the states.</p>

<p>The pastoral period extended from 1769 to 1848. The live-stock
industry was introduced by the Franciscans and flourished
exceedingly. In 1834, when the missions had already passed
their best days, there were some 486,000 cattle, horses, mules
and asses on the ranges, and 325,000 small animals, principally
sheep. Throughout the pre-American period stock-raising
was the leading industry; it built up the prosperity of the
missions, largely supported the government and almost exclusively
sustained foreign commerce. Hides and tallow were
the sum and substance of Californian economy. Horses were
slaughtered wholesale at times to make way for cattle on the
ranges. There was almost no dairying; olive oil took the place
of butter, and wine of milk, at the missions; and in general
indeed the Mexicans were content with water. In the development
of the state under the American regime the live-stock
industry has been subordinate. A fearful drought in 1862-1864
greatly depressed it, and especially discouraged cattle ranching.
Sheep then became of primary importance, until the increase
of the flocks threatened ranges and forests with destruction.
As late as 1876 there were some 7,000,000 sheep, in 1900 only
2,581,000, and in 1906 only 1,750,000. In the total value of
all live stock (5,402,297 head) in 1900 ($65,000,000) the rank of
the state was 15th in the Union, and in value of dairy products
in 1899 (12.84 million dollars) 12th. The live-stock industry
showed a tendency to decline after 1890, and the dairy industry
also, despite various things&mdash;notably irrigation and alfalfa
culture&mdash;that have favoured them.</p>

<p>Cereals replaced hides and tallow in importance after 1848.
Wheat was long California&rsquo;s greatest crop. Its production
steadily increased till about 1884, the production in 1880, the
banner year, being more than 54 million bushels (32,537,360
centals). Since 1884 its production has markedly fallen off;
in 1905 the wheat crop was 17,542,013 bushels, and in 1906,
26,883,662 bushels (valued at $20,162,746). There has been a
general parallelism between the amount of rain and the amount
of wheat produced; but as yet irrigation is little used for this
crop. In the eighth decade of the 19th century, the value of the
wheat product had come to exceed that of the annual output
of gold. Barley has always been very important. The acreage
given to it in 1899 was one-fourth the total cereal acreage, and
San Francisco in 1902-1904 was the shipping point of the larger
part of American exported barley, of (roughly) three-quarters
in 1902, seven-eighths in 1903 and four-fifths in 1904. In 1906
California produced 38,760,000 bushels of barley, valued at
$20,930,400. The great increase in the acreage of barley, which
was 22.5% of the country&rsquo;s barley acreage in 1906, and 24.2%
in 1905, is one reason for the decreased production of wheat.
The level nature of the great grain farms of the valley led to the
utilization of machinery of remarkable character. Combined
harvesters (which enter a field of standing grain and leave this
grain piled in sacks ready for shipment), steam gang-ploughs,
and other farm machinery are of truly extraordinary size and
efficiency. In 1899 cereals represented more than a third of the
total crop acreage and crop product ($93,641,334) of the state.
Wheat and other cereals are in part cut for hay, and the hay crop
of 1906 was 1,133,465 tons, valued at $12,751,481. California
is one of the leading hop-producing states of the Union, the
average annual production since 1901 being more than 10,000,000
lb. The product of sugar beets increased between 1888 and
1902 from 1910 to 73,761 tons (according to the state board of
trade), and in 1909 (according to the department of agriculture)
it was 882,084 tons, from which 254,544,000 lb of sugar was
manufactured. In this industry California in 1909 ranked
second to Colorado. Truck gardening for export is an
assured industry, especially in the north. Great quantities of
vegetables, fresh and canned, are shipped yearly, and the same
is true on a far larger scale of fruit. Vegetable exports more
than doubled between 1894 and 1903. In 1899 hay and grain
represented slightly more than a third of the farm acreage
and capital and also of the value of all farm products;
live-stock and dairy farms represented slightly more than
half the acreage, and slightly under 30% of the capital and
produce; fruit farms absorbed 6.2% of the acreage and 27%
of the capital, and returned 22.5% of the value of farm
produce.</p>

<p><i>Fruit-growing.</i>&mdash;Horticulture is now the principal industry,
and in this field California has no rival in the United States,
although ranking after Florida in the growth of some tropical
or semi-tropical fruits,&mdash;pineapples, guava, limes, pomeloes or
grape-fruit and Japanese persimmons. In 1899 California&rsquo;s
output of fruit was more than a fifth of that of the whole Union.
The supremacy of the state is established in the growth of oranges,
lemons, citrons, olives, figs, almonds, Persian (or English)
walnuts, plums and prunes, grapes and raisins, nectarines,
apricots and pomegranates; it also leads in pears, and peaches,
but here its primacy is not so assured. Southern California
by no means monopolizes the warm-zone fruits. Oranges,
lemons and walnuts come chiefly from that section, but citrus
fruits grow splendidly in the Sierra foothills of the Sacramento
Valley, and indeed ripen earlier there than in the southern
district. Almonds, as well as peaches, pears, plums, cherries
and apricots, come mainly from the north. Over half of the
prune crop comes from Santa Clara county, and the bulk of the
raisin output from Fresno county. Olives thrive as far north
as the head of the Great Valley, growing in all the valleys and
foothills up to 1500 or 2000 ft. They were introduced by the
Franciscans (as were various other subtropical fruits, pears and
grapes), but their scientific betterment and commercial importance
date from about 1885. They grow very abundantly and of
the finest quality; for many years poor methods of preparation
prejudiced the market against the Californian product, but this
has ceased to be the case. The modern orange industry practically
began with the introduction into Southern California in 1873
of two seedless orange trees from Brazil; from their stock have
been developed by budding millions of trees bearing a seedless
fruit known as the &ldquo;Washington navel,&rdquo; which now holds first
rank in American markets; other varieties, mainly seedlings,
are of great but secondary importance. Shipments continue
the year round. There has been more than one horticultural
excitement in California, but especially in orange culture, which
was for a time almost as epidemic a fever as gold seeking once
was. By reason of the co-operative effort demanded for the
large problems of irrigation, packing and marketing, the citrus
industry has done much for the permanent development of the
state, and its extraordinary growth made it, towards the close
of the 19th century, the most striking and most potent single
influence in the growth of agriculture. State legislation has
advanced the fruit interest in all possible ways. Between 1872
and 1903 exports of canned fruits increased from 91 to 94,205
short tons; between 1880 and 1903 the increase of dried fruit exports
was from 295 to 149,531 tons; of fresh deciduous fruits, from
2590 to 101,199; of raisins, from 400 to 39,963; of citrus fruits,
from 458 to 299,623; of wines and brandies between 1891 and
1903, from 47,651 to 97,332 tons. Of the shipments in 1903
some 44% were from Southern California,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> from the seven
southernmost counties.</p>

<p>Grape culture has a great future in California. Vines were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span>
first introduced by the Franciscans in 1771 from Spain, and
until after 1860 &ldquo;Mission&rdquo; grapes were practically the only stock
in California. Afterwards many hundreds of European varieties
were introduced with great success. &ldquo;The state has such a
variety of soil, slope, elevation, temperature and climatic
conditions as to reproduce, somewhere within its borders, any
wine now manufactured&rdquo; (United States Census, 1900); but
experience has not as yet divided the state into districts of
specialized produce, nor determined just how far indigenous
American vines may profitably be used, either as base or graftings,
with European varieties. Grapes are grown very largely over
the state. Raisins do well as far north as Yolo county, but do
best in Madera, Fresno, Kings, Tulare and San Diego counties.
The product is more than sufficient for the markets of the
United States. Dry wine grapes do best in the counties around
San Francisco Bay, on unirrigated lands; while sweet wine
stocks do best in Yolo, San Joaquin and the counties of the
raisin grape, and on irrigated lands. In 1900 California produced
about three-fifths in value ($3,937,871) and in 1905 the same
proportion ($6,688,620) of the wine output of the United
States. The value of product more than sextupled from 1880
to 1900. In quantity the product was more than four times the
combined product of all other states. The better California
wines are largely sold under French labels. Brandies are an
important product. They are made chiefly from grapes, and
are used to fortify wines. It was officially estimated that in the
spring of 1904 there were some 227,000 acres of vineyards in
the state, of which exactly five-tenths were in wine grapes and
four-tenths in raisin grapes.</p>

<p><i>Gold.</i>&mdash;Between the pastoral period and the era of wheat was
the golden epoch of Californian history. The existence of gold
had long been suspected, and possibly known, in California before
1848, and there had been desultory washings in parts where
there was very little to reward prospectors. The first perfectly
authenticated discovery was made near Los Angeles in 1842.
The discovery of real historical importance was made in January
1848 (the 24th is the correct date) at John A. Sutter&rsquo;s mill, on
the south fork of the American river near Coloma, by a workman,
James W. Marshall (1810-1885). His monument now marks
the spot. From 1848 to the 1st of January 1903, according to
the state mining bureau, California produced $1,379,275,408
in gold. There were two periods of intense excitement. The
first ended in 1854, at which time there was a decided reaction
throughout the United States in regard to mining matters.
The Californian discoveries had given rise to a general search
for metalliferous deposits in the Atlantic states, and this bad
been followed by wild speculations. At the time of their greatest
productiveness, from 1850 to 1853, the highest yield of the
washings was probably not less than $65,000,000 a year; according
to the state mining bureau the average production from
1851-1854 was $73,570,087 ($81,294,270 in 1852, the banner
year), and from 1850-1861 $55,882,861, never falling below
$50,000,000. The estimates of other competent authorities
differ considerably, and generally are somewhat less generous
than these figures.</p>

<p>At first the diggings were chiefly along the rivers. These
were &ldquo;flumed,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the water was diverted by wooden
flumes from the natural channel and the sand and gravel
in the bed were washed. All the &ldquo;gulches&rdquo; or ravines leading
down into the canyons were also worked over, with or
without water. These were the richest &ldquo;placers,&rdquo; but in them
the gold was very unequally distributed. Those who first got
possession of the rich bars on the American, Yuba, Feather,
Stanislaus and the other smaller streams in the heart of the
gold region, made sometimes from $1000 to $5000 a day; but
after one rich spot was worked out it might be days or weeks
before another was found. In 1848 $500-700 a day was not
unusual luck; but, on the other hand, the income of the great
majority of miners was certainly far less than that of men who
seriously devoted themselves to trade or even to common
labour. Many extraordinary nuggets were found, varying
from $1000 to $20,000 in value. The economic stimulus given by
such times may be imagined. For several years gold-dust was
a regular circulating medium in the cities as well as in the mining
districts of the state. An ounce of dust in 1848 frequently went
for $4 instead of $17; for a number of years traders in dust
were sure of a margin of several dollars, as for example in private
coinage, mints for which were common by 1851. From the
record of actual exports and a comparison of the most authoritative
estimates of total production, it may be said that from
1848 to 1856 the yield was almost certainly not less than
$450,000,000, and that about 1870 the billion dollar mark had
been passed. Just at this time came the highest point and the
sudden fall of the second great mining fever of the state. This
was a stock speculation based on the remarkable output
($300,000,000 in 20 years) of the silver &ldquo;bonanzas&rdquo; of the
Comstock lode at Virginia City, Nevada, which were opened
and financed by San Francisco capitalists. The craze pervaded
all classes. Shares that at first represented so many dollars
per foot in a tangible mine were multiplied and remultiplied
until they came to represent paper thicknesses or almost nothing,
yet still their prices mounted upward. In April 1872 came the
revulsion; there was a shrinkage of $60,000,000 in ten days;
then in 1873 a tremendous advance, and in 1875 a final and
disastrous collapse; in ten years thereafter the stock of the
Comstock lode shrank from $3,000,000 to $2,000,000. This
Comstock fever belongs to Californian rather than to Nevadan
history, and is one of the most extraordinary in mining
annals.</p>

<p>First the &ldquo;rocker,&rdquo; then the &ldquo;tom,&rdquo; the &ldquo;flume,&rdquo; and the
hydraulic stream were the tools of the miner. Into the &ldquo;rocker&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;tom&rdquo; the miner shovelled dirt, rocking it as he poured
in water, catching the gold on riffles set across the bottom of his
box; thus imitating in a wooden box the work of nature in the
rivers. The &ldquo;flume&rdquo; enabled him to dry the bed of a stream
while he worked over its gravels. The hydraulic stream came
into use as early as 1852 (or 1853) when prospecting of the
higher ground made it certain that the &ldquo;deep&rdquo; or &ldquo;high&rdquo;
gravels&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the detrital deposits of tertiary age&mdash;contained
gold, though in too small quantities to be profitably worked in
the ordinary way. The hydraulic process received an immense
development through successive improvements of method and
machinery. In this method tremendous blasts of powder,
sometimes twenty-five or even fifty tons, were used to loosen the
gravel, which was then acted on by the jet of water thrown from
the &ldquo;pipes.&rdquo; To give an idea of the force of the agent thus
employed it may be stated that when an eight-inch nozzle is
used under a heavy head, more than 3000 ft. may be discharged
in a minute with a velocity of 150 ft. per second. The water as
it thus issues from the nozzle feels to the touch like metal, and
the strongest man cannot sensibly affect it with a crowbar.
A gravel bank acted on by such tremendous force crumbled
rapidly, and the disintegrated material could be run readily
through sluices to the &ldquo;dumps.&rdquo; Hydraulic mining is no longer
practised on the scale of early days. The results were wonderful
but disastrous, for the &ldquo;dumps&rdquo; were usually river-beds.
From 1870-1879 the bed of Bear river was raised in places in its
lower course 97 ft. by the detritus wash of the hydraulic mines,
and that of Sleepy Hollow Creek 136 ft. The total filling up to
that time on the streams in this vicinity had been from 100 to
250 ft., and many thousand acres of fine farming land were
buried under gravel,&mdash;some 16,000 on the lower Yuba alone.
For many years the mining interests were supreme, and agriculture,
even after it had become of great importance, was
invariably worsted when the two clashed; but in 1884 the long
and bitter &ldquo;anti-d√©bris&rdquo; or &ldquo;anti-slickins&rdquo; fight ended in favour
of the farmers. In 1893 the United States government created
a California D√©bris Commission, which has acted in unison with
the state authorities. Permits for hydraulic mining are granted
by the commission only when all gravel is satisfactorily
impounded and no harm is done to the streams; and the
improvement of these, which was impossible so long as limits
were not set to hydraulic mining, can now be effectively advanced.
Quartz mining began as early as 1851. In 1908 about five-eighths
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span>
of the gold output was from such mines. Quartz veins are
very often as good at a depth of 3000 ft. as at the surface.
A remarkable feature of recent years (especially since 1900) is
gold &ldquo;dredging.&rdquo; Thousands of acres even of orchard, vineyard
and farming land have been thus treated in recent years.
Gold was being produced in 1906 in more than thirty counties.
The annual output since 1875 has been about $15,000,000
to $17,000,000; in 1905, according to the Mines Report, it
was $18,898,545. Colorado now excels California as a gold
producer.</p>

<p><i>Mineral Products.</i>&mdash;California produces more than forty
mineral substances that are of commercial significance. Gold,
petroleum, copper, borax and its products, clays, quicksilver
and silver lead, in order of importance, representing some four-fifths
of the total. From 1894 to 1902 the aggregate production
increased from 20.2 to 35.1 million dollars; in 1908 it was
$65,137,636. Metallic products long represented three-fourths of
the total, but the feature of recent years has been the rising
importance of hydrocarbons and gases, and of structural materials,
and indeed of non-metallic products generally. The production
of crude petroleum has grown very rapidly since about 1895.
Oil is found from north to south over some 600 m., but especially
in Southern California. The high cost of coal, which has always
been a hindrance to the development of manufactures, makes
the petroleum deposits of peculiar value. Their total output
increased from 4,250,000 to 44,854,737 barrels between 1900
and 1908, and the value of the product in 1908 was $23,433,502.
The Kern river field is the most important in the state and one
of the greatest in the world. Those of Coalinga, Santa Maria
and Lompoc, and Los Angeles are next in importance. Both
in 1900 and in 1905 California ranked fifth among the states of
the United States in the petroleum refining industry. Copper
has risen in importance in very recent years; it is mined mainly
in Shasta county; the value of the state&rsquo;s total product in 1908
was $5,232,986. Gold mining still centres in the mountainous
counties north of Tuolumne. This is the region of quartz mining.
In borax (of which California&rsquo;s output in 1904 was 45,647 tons)
and structural materials San Bernardino has a long lead. More
than nine-tenths of the borax product of the country comes from
about Death Valley. San Bernardino marbles have a very high
repute. California was the fourth state of the Union in 1908 in
the production of granite. It furnishes about two-fifths of the
quicksilver of the world. This has been mined since 1824; the
output was greatest from 1875-1883, when it averaged about
43,000,000 pounds. The New Almaden mine (opened in 1824) in
Santa Clara county produced from 1850 to 1896 some 73,000,000
pounds. The centre of production is north and south of San
Francisco Bay. Californian coal is almost wholly inferior brown
lignite, together with a small quantity of bituminous coals of
poor quality; the state does not produce a tenth part of the
coal it consumes. Of growing importance are the gems found
in California: a few diamonds in Butte county; rock crystal
in Calaveras county; and tourmalines, kunzite, the rare
pink beryl and bright blue topazes in San Diego county.
Chrysoprase, mined near Porterville and near Visalia (Tulare
county), is used partly for gems, but more largely (like the
vesuvianite found near Exeter, in the same county) for mosaic
work; and there are ledges of fine rose quartz in the Coahuila
mountains of Riverside county and near Lemon Cove, Tulare
county.</p>

<p>A vivid realization of the industrial revolution in the state
is to be gained from the reflection that in 1875 California was
pre-eminent only for gold and sheep; that the aggregate mineral
output thirty years later was more than a third greater than then,
and that nevertheless the value of farm produce at the opening
of the 20th century exceeded by more than $100,000,000 the
value of mineral produce, and exceeded by $50,000,000 the
most generous estimate of the largest annual gold output in the
annals of the state.</p>

<p><i>Manufactures.</i>&mdash;Previous to 1860 almost every manufactured
article used in the state was imported from the east or from
Europe. Dairy products, for example, for whose production
good facilities always existed, were long greatly neglected, and
not for two decades at least after 1848 was the state independent
in this respect. The high cost of coal, the speculative attractions
of mining, and the high wages of labour, handicapped the
development of manufactures in early years. The first continued
to be a drag on such industries, until after 1895 the increasing
use of crude petroleum obviated the difficulty. Several remarkable
electric power and lighting plants utilize the water power
of the mountains.<a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Geographic isolation has somewhat fostered
state industries. The value of gross manufactured products
increased 41.9% from 1890 to 1900. In the latter year California
ranked 12th among the states in the gross value of all manufactures
($302,874,761); the per-capita value of manufactured and
agricultural products being $293,&mdash;$89 of the latter, $204 of the
former. Of the wage-earners 61% were engaged in manufacturing.
Fourteen industries represented from 41% to 45% of the
employees, wages, capital and product of the aggregate manufacturers
of the state. The leading ones in order of importance
and the value of product in millions of dollars were: the manufacture
of railway, foundry, and machine shop products (19.6
million dollars), lumber and timber industries (18.57), sugar and
molasses refining (15.91), beef slaughtering (15.72), canning and
preserving (13.08), flour and grist milling (13.10), the manufacture
of malt, vinous and distilled liquors (9.26), leather industries
(7.40), printing and publishing (6.86). In the second, third and
fifth of these industries the state ranked respectively fifth,
fourth and first in the Union.<a name="fa5a" id="fa5a" href="#ft5a"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The canning and preserving of
fruits and vegetables is in the main an industry of the northern
and central counties. In 1890 the state board of forestry
estimated that the redwood forests were in danger of exhaustion
by 1930. The redwood is a general utility lumber second only
to the common white pine, and the drain on the woods has been
continuous since 1850. The wood has a fine, straight and even
grain; and though light and soft, is firm and extremely durable,
lying, it is authoritatively asserted, for centuries in the forest
without appreciable decay. It takes a beautiful polish. The
colour varies from cedar colour to mahogany. A small southern
belt in San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties is not
being commercially exploited. The annual lumber cut from
1898-1903 averaged more than 663,348,000 ft.; of the
852,638,000 ft. cut in 1903, 465,460,000 were of redwood, and
264,890,000 of yellow pine; fir and sugar pines contributing
another 104,600,000, and spruce and cedar 17,670,000 ft. In
1900 California ranked 16th among the states in value of product
($13,764,647, out of a total of $566,852,984). The total cut was
under ¬Ω of 1% of the estimated stand. In Humboldt county,
in the redwood belt near Eureka, are probably the most modern
and remarkable lumber mills of the world. In 1900 it was
estimated that lumbermen controlled somewhat less than a fifth
of the timber of the state, and the same part of the redwood.
After 1890 important shipyards were established near San
Francisco. The most important naval station of the United
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span>
States on the Pacific coast is at Mare Island at the northern end
of San Francisco Bay, and the private Union Iron Works, on the
peninsula near San Francisco, is one of the largest shipyards of
the country. In 1905 more than one-half of the factory product
was the output of four cities: San Francisco ($137,788,233),
Los Angeles ($34,814,475), Sacramento ($10,319,416) and Fresno
($9,849,001); next ranked Oakland, Stockton, and San Jos√©.</p>

<p>The transportation facilities in California increased rapidly
after 1870. The building of the Central Pacific and Union
Pacific lines are among the romances of American railway
history. They joined tracks near Ogden, Utah, in May 1869.
The New Orleans line of the Southern Pacific was opened in
January 1883; the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa F√© completed its
line to San Diego in 1885, and to San Francisco Bay in 1900.
The San Pedro, Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake, with trans-continental
connexions at the eastern terminus, was chartered in 1901 and
fully opened in March 1903. Railway mileage increased 137.3%
from 1870 to 1880, and 154.6% from 1880 to 1900. At the
close of 1908 the total mileage was 7039.36 m., practically all
of which is either owned or controlled by the two great
trans-continental systems of the Southern Pacific and the Atchison,
Topeka &amp; Santa F√©. From 1869 to 1875 registered mail exchanges
were opened with China, Japan, Hawaii and Australia.
There are now frequent mail connexions from San Francisco with
Hawaii, Australasia, and eastern Asia, as well as with American
ports north and south. The commerce of San Francisco amounts
to some $80,000,000 or $90,000,000 yearly, about equally
divided between imports and exports, until after 1905&mdash;in 1907
the imports were valued at $54,207,011, and the exports at
$30,378,355 (less than any year since 1896). San Diego has a
very good harbour, and the harbours of San Pedro (Los Angeles)
and Eureka are fairly good and of growing importance. Grains,
lumber, fish, fruits and fruit products, petroleum, vegetables and
sugar are the leading items in the commerce of San Francisco.
Other ports are of very secondary importance. Navigation on
the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers was very important in
early days, but is to-day of relatively slight importance in
comparison with railway traffic.</p>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The population of California increased in
successive decades from 1850 to 1910 respectively by 310.3, 47.3,
54.3, 40.3, 22.4 and 60.1%. (The percentage of increase in
1900-1910 was exceeded in Washington, Oklahoma, Idaho, Nevada,
North Dakota and Oregon.) In 1910 the total population
was 2,377,549, or 15.2 per sq. m. In 1900 there were 116 incorporated
towns and cities; and of the total population 43.3% was urban,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
resident in cities (11 in number) of 8000 or more inhabitants.
These 11 cities were: San Francisco (pop. 342,782), Los Angeles
(102,479), Oakland (66,960), Alameda (16,464), Berkeley
(13,214),&mdash;the last three being suburbs of San Francisco, and the
last the seat of the state university,&mdash;Sacramento, the state capital
(29,282), San Jos√© (21,500), San Diego (17,700), Stockton
(17,506), Fresno (12,470), and Pasadena (9117). Eight other
cities had populations of more than 5000&mdash;Riverside City
(7973), Vallejo (7965), Eureka (7327), Santa Rosa (6673), Santa
Barbara (6587), San Bernardino (6156), Santa Cruz (5659),
and Pomona (5526).</p>

<p>Of the entire population in 1900 persons of foreign birth or
parentage (one or both parents being foreign) constituted 54.2
and those of native birth were 75.3%. Of the latter six-tenths
were born in California. The foreign element included 45,753
Chinese (a falling off of 25,313 since 1890), and 10,151 Japanese
(an increase of 9004 in the same decade). Twenty-two foreign
countries contributed over 1000 residents each, the leading ones
being the United Kingdom (91,638), Germany (72,449), Canada
(29,618; 27,408 being English Canadians), Italy (22,777), Sweden
(14,549), France (12,256), Portugal (12,068), Switzerland
(10,974), Japan, Denmark, and Mexico, in the order named.
Persons of negro descent numbered 11,045. Almost all the Indians
of the state are taxed as citizens. In 1906 of 611,464 members
of religious denominations 354,408 were Roman Catholics,
64,528 Methodist Episcopalians, 37,682 Presbyterians, 26,390
Congregationalists, 24,801 Baptists, 21,317 Protestant Episcopalians,
11,371 Lutherans, and 9,110 members of Eastern Orthodox
churches. A peculiar feature in the population statistics of
California is the predominance of males, which in 1900 was
156,009; the Asiatic element accounts for a third of this number.
Since 1885 the eight counties south of the Tehachapi Range,
which are known collectively and specifically as Southern California
have greatly advanced in population. In 1880 their population
was 7.3, in 1890 17.2, and in 1900 20.1% of the total population of
the state. The initial impulse to this increase was the beginning
of the &ldquo;fruit epoch&rdquo; in these counties, combined with a railway
&ldquo;rate-war&rdquo; following the completion to the coast in 1885 of the
Santa Fe, and an extraordinary land boom prevailing from
1886 to 1888. The conjuncture of circumstances, and the
immigration it induced, were unusual. The growth of the South,
as of the rest of the state, has been continuous and steady.</p>

<p>The Indians were prominent in early Californian history, but
their progress toward their present insignificance began far back
in the Spanish period. It proceeded much more rapidly after
the restraining influence of the missions was removed, leaving
them free to revert to savagery; and the downward progress
of the race was fearfully accelerated during the mining period,
when they were abused, depraved, and in large numbers killed.
There have been no Indian wars in California&rsquo;s annals, but many
butcheries. The natives have declined exceedingly in number
since 1830, in 1900 numbering 15,377. They have always been
mild-tempered, low, and unintelligent, and are to-day a poor
and miserable race. They are all called &ldquo;Digger Indians&rdquo;
indiscriminately, although divided by a multiplicity of tongues.</p>

<p><i>Government and Institutions.</i>&mdash;In the matter of
constitution-making
California has been conservative, having had only two
between 1849 and 1910. The first was framed by a convention
at Monterey in 1849, and ratified by the people and proclaimed
by the United States military governor in the same year. The
present constitution, framed by a convention in 1878-1879, came
into full effect in 1880, and was subsequently amended. It was
the work of the labour party, passed at a time of high discontent,
and goes at great length into the details of government, as was
demanded by the state of public opinion. The qualifications
required for the suffrage are in no way different from those
common throughout the Union, except that by a constitutional
amendment of 1894 it is necessary for a voter to be able to read
the state constitution and write his name. As compared with
the earlier constitution it showed many radical advances toward
popular control, the power of the legislature being everywhere
curtailed. The power of legislation was taken from it by specific
inhibition in thirty-one subjects before within its power; its
control of the public domain, its powers in taxation, and its use
of the state credit were carefully safe-guarded. &ldquo;Lobbying&rdquo;
was made a felony; provisions were inserted against lotteries
and stock-exchange gambling, to tax and control common
carriers and great corporations, and to regulate telegraph,
telephone, storage and wharfage charges. The powers of the
executive department were also somewhat curtailed. For the
judiciary, provisions were made for expediting trials and decisions.
Notable was the innovation that agreement by three-fourths
of a jury should be sufficient in civil cases and that a jury
might be waived in minor criminal cases, a provision which of
course was based on experience under the Mexican law. All
these changes in the organic law reflect bitter experience after
1850; and, read with the history of those years as a commentary,
few American constitutions are more instructive. The constitution
of 1879 corresponds very closely to the ordinary state
constitution of to-day. The incorporation of banks issuing
circulating notes is forbidden. Marriage is not only declared
a civil contract, but the laws expressly recognize that the mere
consent of the parties is adequate to constitute a binding
marriage. The union of whites with persons of African descent
is forbidden. Felons twice convicted may not be pardoned
except on the recommendation of a majority of the judges of the
supreme court. Judges and state executive officers are elected
for terms longer than is usual in the different states (supreme
judges 12 years, executive officers 4 years). These few provisions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>
are mentioned, not as of particular importance in themselves,
but as exceptions of some moment to the usual type of state
Constitutions (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">United States</a></span>). The Australian ballot was
introduced in 1891. In local government there are no deviations
from the usual types that demand notice. In the matter of
liquor-laws there is local option, and a considerable proportion
of the towns and smaller cities, particularly in the south, adopt
prohibition. In most of the rest high licence is more or less
strictly enforced.</p>

<p>The total assessed valuation of property grew from
$666,399,985 in 1880 to $1,217,648,683 in 1900 and
$1,879,728,763 in 1907. In 1904, when the U.S. Census Report
showed California to be the twenty-first state of the Union in
population but the sixth in wealth, the total estimated true
value of all property was $4,115,491,106, of which $2,664,472,025
was the value of real property and improvements thereon.
The per capita wealth of the state was then reported as $2582.32,
being exceeded only by the three sparsely settled states of
Montana, Wyoming and Nevada. In 1898 California had the
largest savings-bank deposit per depositor ($637.75) of any
state in the Union; the <i>per caput</i> deposit was $110 in 1902, and
about one person in seven was a depositor. The state bonded debt
in 1907 amounted to three and a half million dollars, of which all
but $767,529.03 was represented by bonds purchased by the state
and held for the school and university funds; for the common
school fund on the 1st of July 1907 there were held bonds for
$4,890,950, and $800,000 in cash available for investment; for
the university fund there were held $751,000 in state bonds,
and a large amount in other securities. The total bonded county
indebtedness was $4,879,600 in 1906 (not including that of San
Francisco, a consolidated city and county, which was $4,568,600).
A homestead, entered upon record and limited to a value of
$5000 if held by the head of a family and to a value of $1000
if held by one not the head of a family, is exempt from liability for
debts, except for a mortgage, a lien before it was claimed as a homestead
or a lien afterward for improvements. A homestead held by
a married man cannot be mortgaged without consent of his wife.</p>

<p>Under an act approved on the 25th of March 1903 a state
board of charities and corrections,&mdash;consisting of six members,
not more than three being of the same political party, appointed
by the governor, with the advice and consent of the senate,
and holding office for twelve years, two retiring at the end of each
quadrennium,&mdash;investigates, examines, and makes &ldquo;reports
upon the charitable, correctional and penal institutions of the
state,&rdquo; excepting the Veterans&rsquo; Home at Yountville, Napa
county, and the Woman&rsquo;s Relief Corps Home at Evergreen,
Santa Clara county. There are state prisons with convicts
working under the public account system, at San Quentin,
Marin county, and Folsom, Sacramento county. The Preston
(Sonoma county) School of Industry, for older boys, and the
Whittier (Los Angeles county) State School, for girls and for
boys under sixteen, are the state reformatories, each having
good industrial and manual training departments. There are
state hospitals for the insane at Agnew, Santa Clara county;
at Stockton, San Joaquin county; at Napa, Napa county; at
Patton, San Bernardino county; and, with a colony of tubercular
patients, at Ukiah, Mendocino county. In 1906 the ratio of
insane confined to institutions, to the total population, was
1 to every 270. Also under state control are the home for care
and training of feeble-minded children, at Eldridge, Sonoma
county; the institution for the deaf and the blind at Berkeley,
and the home of mechanical trades for the adult blind at Oakland.
A Juvenile Court Law was enacted in 1903 and modified in 1905.</p>

<p>The educational system of California is one of the best in the
country. The state board of education is composed of the
governor of the state, who is its president; the superintendent of
public instruction, who is its secretary; the presidents of the
five normal schools and of the University of California, and the
professor of pedagogy in the university. Sessions are long in
primary schools, and attendance was made compulsory in 1874
(and must not be less than two-thirds of all school days). The
state controlled the actual preparation and sale of text-books
for the common schools from 1885 to 1903, when the Perry
amendment to the constitution (ratified by popular vote in 1884)
was declared to mean that such text-books must be manufactured
within the state, but that the texts need not be prepared in
California. The experiment of state-prepared text-books was
expensive, and its effect was bad on the public school system,
as such text-books were almost without exception poorly written
and poorly printed. After 1903 copyrights were leased by the
state. Secondary schools are closely affiliated with, and closely
inspected by, the state university. All schools are generously
supported, salaries are unusually good, and pension funds in all
cities are authorized by state laws. The value of school
property in 1900 was $19,135,722, and the expenditure for
the public schools $6,195,000; in 1906 the value of school
property was $29,013,150, and the expenditure for public
schools $10,815,857. The average school attendance for all
minors of school age (5-20 years) was 59.9%; of those native-born
61.5, of those foreign-born 34.6; of coloured children, including
Asiatics and Indians, 35.8, and of white, 60.8%. In 1900, 6.2%
of the males of voting age, and 2.4% of the native-born males of
voting age, were illiterate (could not write). Some 3% of the
total population could not speak English; Chinese and Japanese
constituting almost half of the number, foreign-born whites
somewhat less, and Indians and native-born whites of foreign
parentage together less than a tenth of the total. Of the higher
educational institutions of the state the most important are the
state university at Berkeley and Leland Stanford Jr. University
at Palo Alto. The former is supported with very great liberality
by the state; and the latter, the endowment of which is private
(the state, however, exempting it from taxation), is one of the
richest educational institutions of America. In 1906 there were
also five state normal schools (at Chico, Los Angeles, San Diego,
San Francisco, and San Jos√©), and a considerable number of
denominational colleges. There is also a state polytechnic
school at San Luis Obispo (1903).</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The name &ldquo;California&rdquo; was taken from Ordo√±ez de
Montalvo&rsquo;s romance of chivalry <i>Las Sergas de Esplandian</i>
(Madrid, 1510), in which is told of black Amazons ruling an island
of this name &ldquo;to the right of the Indies, very near the quarter
of the terrestrial paradise.&rdquo; The name was given to the unknown
north-west before 1540. It does not show that the namers were
prophets or wise judges, for the Spaniards really knew California
not at all for more than two centuries, and then only as a genial
but rather barren land; but it shows that the <i>conquistadores</i>
mixed poetry with business and illustrates the glamour thrown
about the &ldquo;Northern Mystery.&rdquo; Necessarily the name had for
a long time no definite geographical meaning. The lower
Colorado river was discovered in 1540, but the explorers did not
penetrate California; in 1542-1543 Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo
explored at least the southern coast; in 1579 Sir Francis Drake
repaired his ships in some Californian port (almost certainly not
San Francisco Bay), and named the land New Albion; two
Philippine ships visited the coast in 1584 and 1595, and in 1602
and 1603 Sebastian Vizcaino discovered the sites of San Diego
and Monterey. There was apparently no increase of knowledge
thereafter for 150 years. Most of this time California was
generally supposed to be an island or a group of islands. Jesuit
missionaries entered Lower California as early as 1697, maintaining
themselves there until Charles III.&rsquo;s expulsion in 1767 of all
Jesuits from his dominions; but not until Russian explorations
in Alaska from 1745-1765 did the Spanish government show
interest in Upper California. Because of these explorations, and
also the long-felt need of a refitting point on the California coast
for the galleons from Manila, San Diego was occupied in 1769
and Monterey in 1770 as a result of urgent orders from Charles
III. San Francisco Bay was discovered in the former year. Meanwhile
the Jesuit property in the Peninsula had been turned over
to Franciscan monks, but in 1772 the Dominicans took over the
missions, and the Franciscans not unwillingly withdrew to Upper
California, where they were to thrive remarkably for some fifty
years.</p>

<p>This is the mission period&mdash;or from an economic standpoint,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>17</span>
the pastoral period&mdash;of Californian history. In all, twenty-one
missions were established between 1769 and 1823. The
<span class="sidenote">The rule of the missions.</span>
leader in this movement was a really remarkable man,
Miguel Jos√© Serra (known as Junipero Serra, 1713-1784),
a friar of very great ability, purest piety, and
tireless zeal. He possessed great influence in Mexico and Madrid.
&ldquo;The theory of the mission system,&rdquo; says H.H. Bancroft, &ldquo;was
to make the savages work out their own salvation and that of
the priests also.&rdquo; The last phrase scarcely does justice to the
truly humane and devout intentions of the missionaries; but in
truth the mission system was a complete failure save in the
accumulation of material wealth. Economically the missions
were the blood and life of the province. At them the neophytes
worked up wool, tanned hides, prepared tallow, cultivated hemp
and wheat, raised a few oranges, made soap, some iron and
leather articles, mission furniture, and a very little wine and olive
oil. Such as it was, this was about the only manufacturing or
handicraft in California. Besides, the hides and tallow yielded
by the great herds of cattle at the missions were the support of
foreign trade and did much toward paying the expenses of the
government. The Franciscans had no sympathy for profane
knowledge, even among the Mexicans,&mdash;sometimes publicly
burning quantities of books of a scientific or miscellaneous
nature; and the reading of F√©nelon&rsquo;s <i>T√©l√©maque</i> brought excommunication
on a layman. As for the intellectual development
of the neophytes the mission system accomplished nothing;
save the care of their souls they received no instruction, they
were virtually slaves, and were trained into a fatal dependence,
so that once coercion was removed they relapsed at once into
barbarism. It cannot be said, however, that Anglo-Americans
have done much better for them.</p>

<p>The political upheavals in Spain and Mexico following 1808
made little stir in this far-off province. Joseph was never
recognized, and allegiance was sworn to Ferdinand (1809).
When revolution broke out in Mexico (1811), California remained
loyal, suffering much by the cessation of supplies from Mexico,
the resulting deficits falling as an added burden upon the missions.
The occupation of Monterey for a few hours by a Buenos Aires
privateer (1818) was the only incident of actual war that California
saw in all these years; and it, in truth, was a ridiculous
episode, fit introduction to the bloodless play-wars, soon to be
inaugurated in Californian politics. In 1820 the Spanish constitution
was duly sworn to in California, and in 1822 allegiance
was given to Mexico. Under the Mexican Federal constitution
of 1824 Upper California, first alone (it was made a distinct
province in 1804) and then with Lower California, received
representation in the Mexican congress.</p>

<p>The following years before American occupation may be divided
into two periods of quite distinct interest. From about 1840 to
1848 foreign relations are the centre of interest. From 1824 to
1840 there is a complicated and not uninteresting movement of
local politics and a preparation for the future,&mdash;the missions fall,
republicanism grows, the sentiment of local patriotism becomes a
political force, there is a succession of sectional controversies and
personal struggles among provincial chiefs, an increase of foreign
commerce, of foreign immigration and of foreign influence.</p>

<p>The Franciscans were mostly Spaniards in blood and in
sympathies. They viewed with displeasure and foreboding the
fall of Iturbide&rsquo;s empire and the creation of the republic. They
were not treasonable, but talked much, refusing allegiance to
the new government; and as they controlled the resources of
the colony and the good will of the Indians, they felt their
strength against the local authority; besides, they were its
constant benefactors. But secularization was in harmony with
the growth of republican ideas. There was talk in California of
the rights of man and neophytes, and of the sins of friars. The
missions were never intended to be permanent. The missionaries
were only the field workers sent out to convert and civilize
the Indians, who were to be turned over then to the regular
clergy, the monks pushing further onward into new fields. This
was the well-established policy of Spain. In 1813 the Spanish
Cortes ordered the secularization of all missions in America that
were ten years old, but this decree was not published in California
until 1821. After that secularization was the burning question
in Californian politics. In 1826 a beginning toward it was made
in partially emancipating the neophytes, but active and thorough
secularization of the missions did not begin until 1834; by 1835
it was consummated at sixteen missions out of twenty-one, and
by 1840 at all. At some of the missions the monks acted later
as temporary curates for the civil authorities, until in 1845-1846
all the missions were sold by the government. Unfortunately
the manner of carrying it out discredited a policy neither unjust
nor bad in itself, increasing its importance in the political
struggles of the time. The friars were in no way mistreated:
Californians did not share Mexican resentments against Spaniards,
and the national laws directed against these were in the main
quietly ignored in the province. In 1831 the mission question
led to a rising against the reactionary clerical rule of Governor
Manuel Victoria. He was driven out of the province.</p>

<p>This was the first of the op√©ra bouffe wars. The causes
underlying them were serious enough. In the first place, there
was a growing dissatisfaction with Mexican rule, which accomplished
nothing tangible for good in California,&mdash;although its
plans were as excellent as could be asked had there only been
peace and means to realize them; however, it made the mistake
of sending convicts as soldiers. Californians were enthusiastic
republicans, but found the benefits of republicanism slow in
coming. The resentment of the Franciscans, the presence of
these and other reactionaries and of Spaniards, the attitude of
foreign residents, and the ambitions of leading Californian
families united to foment and propagate discontent. The
feeling against Mexicans&mdash;those &ldquo;de la otra banda&rdquo; as they
were significantly termed&mdash;invaded political and even social
life. In the second place, there was growing jealousy between
northern towns and southern towns, northern families and
southern families. These entered into disputes over the location
of the capital and the custom-house, in the Franciscan question
also (because the friars came some from a northern and some
from a southern college), and in the question of the distribution
of commands in the army and offices in the civil government.
Then there was the mission question; this became acuter about
1833 when the friars began to destroy, or sell and realize on, the
mission property. The next decade was one of plunder and ruin
in mission history. Finally there was a real growth of republicanism,
and some rulers&mdash;notably Victoria&mdash;were wholly out of
sympathy with anything but personal, military rule. From all
these causes sprang much unrest and considerable agitation.</p>

<p>In 1828-1829 there was a revolution of unpaid soldiers aided
by natives, against alleged but not serious abuses, that really
aimed at the establishment of an independent native government.
In 1831 Governor Victoria was deposed; in 1836 Governor
Mariano Chico was frightened out of the province; in 1836
Governor Nicolas Gutierrez and in 1844-1845 Governor Manuel
Micheltorena were driven out of office. The leading natives
headed this last rising. There was talk of independence,
but sectional and personal jealousies could not be overcome.
In all these wars there was not enough blood shed to
discolour a sword. The rising of 1836 against Gutierrez seems
to-day most interesting, for it was in part a protest against the
growth of federalism in Mexico. California was even deferred
to as (declared to be seems much too strong a statement) an
Estado Libre y Soberano; and from 1836 to 1838, when the
revolutionary governor, Juan B. Alvarado, was recognized by
the Mexican government, which had again inclined to federalism
and, besides, did not take the matter very seriously, the local
government rested simply on local sentiment. The satisfaction
of this ended all difficulties.</p>

<p>By this time foreign influence was showing itself of importance.
Foreign commerce,  which  of  course  was  contraband,  being
contrary to all Spanish laws, was active by the beginning
of the 19th century. It was greatly stimulated
<span class="sidenote">American immigration.</span>
during the Spanish-American revolutions (the Lima
and Panama trade dating from about 1813), for, as the
Californian authorities practically ignored the law, smuggling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
was unnecessary; this was, indeed, much greater after 1822
under the high duties (in 1836-1840 generally about 100%) of
the Mexican tariffs. In the early &rsquo;forties some three-fourths of
the imports, even at Monterey itself, are said to have paid no
duties, being landed by agreement with the officials. Wholesale
and retail trade flourished all along the coast in defiance of prohibitory
laws. American trade was by far most important. The
Boston traders&mdash;whose direct trade began in 1822, but the indirect
ventures long before that&mdash;were men of decided influence
in California. The trade supplied almost all the clothing,
merchandise and manufactures used in the province; hides and
furs were given in exchange. If foreign trade was not to be
received, still less were foreign travellers, under the Spanish laws.
However, the Russians came in 1805, and in 1812 founded on
Bodega Bay a post they held till 1841, whence they traded and
hunted (even in San Francisco Bay) for furs. From the day of
the earliest foreign commerce sailors and traders of divers
nationalities began to settle in the province. In 1826 American
hunters first crossed to the coast; in 1830 the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
Company began operations in northern California. By this time
the foreign element was considerable in number, and it doubled
in the next six years, although the true overland immigration from
the United States began only about 1840. As a class foreigners
were respected, and they were influential beyond proportion to
their numbers. They controlled commerce, and were more
energetic, generally, than were the natives; many were naturalized,
held generous grants of land, and had married into Californian
families, not excluding the most select and influential.
Most prominent of Americans in the interior was John A. Sutter
(1803-1880), who held a grant of eleven square leagues around
the present site of Sacramento, whereon he built a fort. His
position as a Mexican official, and the location of his fortified
post on the border, commanding the interior country and lying
on the route of the overland immigrants, made him of great importance
in the years preceding and immediately following
American occupation; although he was a man of slight abilities
and wasted his great opportunities. Other settlers in the
coast towns were also of high standing and importance. In
short, Americans were hospitably received and very well treated
by the government and the people; despite some formalities
and ostensible surveillance there was no oppression whatever.
There was, however, some jealousy of the ease with which
Americans secured land grants, and an entirely just dislike of
&ldquo;bad&rdquo; Americans. The sources from which all the immigrants
were recruited made inevitable an element of lawlessness and
truculence. The Americans happened to predominate. Along
with a full share of border individuality and restlessness they
had the usual boisterous boastfulness and a racial contempt,
which was arrogantly proclaimed, for Mexicans,&mdash;often too for
Mexican legal formalities. The early comers were a conservative
<span class="sidenote">American and European intriques.</span>
force in politics, but many of the later comers wanted
to make California a second Texas. As early as 1805
(at the time of James Monroe&rsquo;s negotiations for
Florida), there are traces of Spain&rsquo;s fear of American
ambitions even in this far-away province. It was a fear she felt
for all her American possessions. Spain&rsquo;s fears passed on to
Mexico, the Russians being feared only less than Americans. An
offer was made by President Jackson in 1835 to buy the northern
part of California, including San Francisco Bay, but was refused.
In 1836 and 1844 Americans were prominent in the incidents of
revolution; divided in opinion in both years they were neutral
in the actual &ldquo;hostilities&rdquo; of the latter, but some gave active
support to the governor in 1836. From 1836 on, foreign interference
was much talked about. Americans supposed that
Great Britain wished to exchange Mexican bonds for California;
France also was thought to be watching for an opening for
gratifying supposed ambitions; and all parties saw that even
without overt act by the United States the progress of American
settlement seemed likely to gain them the province, whose
connexion with Mexico had long been a notoriously loose one. A
considerable literature written by travellers of all the countries
named had before this discussed all interests. In 1840 for too
active interest in politics some Americans and Englishmen were
temporarily expelled.</p>

<p>In 1842 Commodore T.A.C. Jones (1789-1858) of the United
States navy, believing that war had broken out between his
country and Mexico and that a British force was about to seize
California, raised the American flag over Monterey (October 21st),
but finding that he had acted on misinformation he lowered the
flag next day with due ceremony and warm apology. In California
this incident served only to open up agreeable personal
relations and social courtesies, but it did not tend to clarify the
diplomatic atmosphere. It showed the ease of seizing the
country, the indifference of the natives, and the resolution of the
United States government. Mexico sought to prevent American
immigration, but the local authorities would not enforce such
orders, however positive. Between 1843 and 1845, Great
Britain, the United States, and France opened consulates. By
1845 there was certainly an agreement in opinion among all
American residents (then not 700 in number) as regards the future
of the country. The policy of France and Great Britain in these
years is unknown. That of the United States is fully known.
In 1845 the American consul at Monterey, Thomas O. Larkin
(1802-1858), was instructed to work for the secession of California
from Mexico, without overt aid from the United States, but with
their good-will and sympathy. He very soon gained from leading
officers assurances of such a movement before 1848. At the same
time American naval officers were instructed to occupy the ports
in case of war with Mexico, but first and last to work for the
good-will of the natives. In 1845 Captain J.C. Fr√©mont,&mdash;whose
doings in California in the next two years were among the
main assets in a life-long reputation and an unsuccessful presidential
campaign,&mdash;while engaged in a government surveying
expedition, aroused the apprehensions of the Californian
authorities by suspicious and very possibly intentionally
provocative movements, and there was a show of military force
by both parties. Fr√©mont had information beyond that of
ordinary men that made him believe early hostilities between the
United States and Mexico to be inevitable; he was also officially
informed of Larkin&rsquo;s secret task and in no way authorized to
hamper it. Resentment, however, incited him to personal
revenge on the Californian government, and an ambition that
clearly saw the gravity of the crisis prompted him to improve it
<span class="sidenote">The &ldquo;Bear Flag.&rdquo;</span>
unscrupulously for his own advancement, leaving his
government to support or disavow him according as
war should come or not. In violation therefore of
international amities, and practically in disobedience of orders,
he broke the peace, caused a band of Mexican cavalry mounts
to be seized, and prompted some American settlers to occupy
Sonoma (14th June 1846). This episode is known as the &ldquo;Bear
Flag War,&rdquo; inasmuch as there was short-lived talk of making
California an independent state, and a flag with a bear as an
emblem (California is still popularly known as the Bear Flag
State) flew for a few days at Sonoma. It was a very small, very
disingenuous, inevitably an anomalous, and in the vanity of
proclamations and other concomitant incidents rather a ridiculous
affair; and fortunately for the dignity of history&mdash;and for
Fr√©mont&mdash;it was quickly merged in a larger question, when
Commodore John Drake Sloat (1780-1867) on the 7th of July
raised the flag of the United States over Monterey, proclaiming
California a part of the United States. The opening hostilities
of the Mexican War had occurred on the Rio Grande. The
excuses and explanations later given by Fr√©mont&mdash;military
preparations by the Californian authorities, the imminence of their
attack, ripening British schemes for the seizure of the province,
etc.&mdash;made up the stock account of historians until the whole
truth came out in 1886 (in Royce&rsquo;s <i>California</i>). Californians had
been very friendly to Americans, but Larkin&rsquo;s intimates thought
they had been tricked, and the people resented the stealthy and
unprovoked breaking of peace, and unfortunately the Americans
did not known how to treat them except inconsiderately and
somewhat contemptuously. The result was a feeble rising in the
south. The country was fully pacified by January 1847. The
aftermath of Fr√©mont&rsquo;s filibustering acts, followed as they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>
by wholly needless hostilities and by some injustice then and
later in the attitude of Americans toward the natives, was a
growing misunderstanding and estrangement, regrettable in
Californian history. Thus there was an end to the &ldquo;lotos-land
society&rdquo; of California. Another society, less hospitable, less
happy, less contented, but also less mild, better tempered for
building states, and more &ldquo;progressive,&rdquo; took the place of
the old.</p>

<p>By the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 Mexico ceded
California to the United States. It was just at this time that
gold was discovered, and the new territory took on
great national importance. The discussion as to what
<span class="sidenote">California ceded to the United States.</span>
should be done with it began in Congress in 1846,
immediately involving the question of slavery. A
furious conflict developed, so that nothing was accomplished in
two successive sessions; even at the end of a third, in March
1849, the only progress made toward creating a government for
the territory was that the national revenue laws had been
extended over it and San Francisco had been made a port of
entry. Meanwhile conditions grew intolerable for the inhabitants.
Before the end of the war Mexican laws not incompatible
with United States laws were by international law supposed to
be in force; but nobody knew what they were, and the uncertainties
of vague and variable alcalde jurisdictions were increased
when Americans began to be alcaldes and grafted English
common-law principles, like the jury, on Californian practice.
Never was a population more in need of clear laws than the
motley Californian people of 1848-1849, yet they had none when,
with peace, military rule and Mexican law technically ended.
There was a curious extra-legal fusion of laws, a half-breed legal
system, and no definite basis for either law or government. Even
the acts and theories of the officials were very inconsistent.
Early in 1849 temporary local governments were set up in
various towns, and in September a convention framed a free-state
constitution and applied for admission to the Union. On
the 7th of September 1850 a bill finally passed Congress admitting
California as a free state. This was one of the bargains in
the &ldquo;Compromise Measures of 1850&rdquo; that were intended to
dispose of the question of slavery in the Territories. Meanwhile
the gold discoveries culminated and surpassed &ldquo;three centuries
of wild talk about gold in California.&rdquo; For three months there
was little excitement, then a wild rush. Settlements were
completely deserted; homes, farms and stores abandoned.
Ships deserted by their sailors crowded the bay at San Francisco&mdash;there
were 500 of them in July 1850; soldiers deserted wholesale,
churches were emptied, town councils ceased to sit,
merchants, clerks, lawyers and judges and criminals, everybody,
flocked to the foothills. Soon, from Hawaii, Oregon and Sonora,
from the Eastern states, the South Seas, Australia, South America
<span class="sidenote">The rush for gold.</span>
and China came an extraordinary flow of the hopeful
and adventurous. In the winter of &rsquo;48 the rush began
from the states to Panama, and in the spring across
the plains. It is estimated that 80,000 men reached the coast
in 1849, about half of them coming overland; three-fourths
were Americans. Rapid settlement, excessive prices, reckless
waste of money, and wild commercial ventures that glutted San
Francisco with all objects usable and unusable made the following
years astounding from an economic point of view; but not less
bizarre was the social development, nor less extraordinary the
problems of state-building in a society &ldquo;morally and socially
tried as no other American community ever has been tried&rdquo;
(Royce). There was of course no home life in early California.
In 1850 women numbered 8% of the population, but only 2%
in the mining counties. The miners were an energetic, covetous,
wandering, abnormally excitable body of men. Occasionally a
kind of frenzy even would seem to seize on them, and lured by
the hope of new deposits of unheard-of richness thousands
would flock on unfounded rumours to new and perhaps distant
localities, where many might perish from disease and starvation,
the rest returning in poverty and rags. Such were the Kern
River fever of 1855 and the greater &ldquo;Fraser River rush&rdquo; of
1858, the latter, which took perhaps 20,000 men out of the state,
causing a terrible amount of suffering. Many interior towns
lost half their population and some virtually all their population
as a result of this emigration; and it precipitated a real estate
crash in San Francisco that threatened temporary ruin. Mining
times in California brought out some of the most ignoble and
some of the best traits of American character. Professor Josiah
Royce has pictured the social-moral process by which society
finally impressed its &ldquo;claims on wayward and blind individuals&rdquo;
who &ldquo;sought wealth and not a social order,&rdquo; and so long as
possible shirked all social obligations. Through varied instruments&mdash;lynch
law, popular courts, vigilance committees&mdash;order
was, however, enforced, better as times went on, until there was
a stable condition of things. In the economic life and social
character of California to-day the legacies of 1848 are plain.</p>

<p>The slavery question was not settled for California in 1850.
Until the Civil War the division between the Whig and Democratic
parties, whose organization in California preceded statehood,
was essentially based on slavery. The struggle fused with
the personal contests of two men, rivals for the United States
Senate, William McKendree Gwin (1805-85, U.S. senator,
1850-55 and 1857-61), the leader of the pro-slavery party, and
David Colbreth Broderick (1819-1859), formerly a leader of
Tammany in New York, and after 1857 a member from California
of the United States Senate, the champion of free labour, who
declared in 1860 for the policy of the Republican party.
Broderick&rsquo;s undoing was resolved upon by the slavery party,
and he was killed in a duel. The Gwin party hoped to divide
California into two states and hand the southern over to slavery;
on the eve of the Civil War it considered the scheme of a Pacific
coast republic. The decade 1850-1860 was also marked by the
activity of filibusters against Sonora and Central America. Two
of these&mdash;a French adventurer, one Gaston Raoux, comte de
Raousset-Boulbon (1817-1854), and William Walker, had very
picturesque careers. The state was thoroughly loyal when war
came. The later &rsquo;fifties are characterized by H.H. Bancroft as
a period of &ldquo;moral, political and financial night.&rdquo; National
politics were put first, to the complete ignoring of excessive
taxation, financial extravagance, ignorant legislation and
corruption in California. The public was exploited for many
years with impunity for the benefit of private interests. One
<span class="sidenote">Disputed land grants.</span>
legacy that ought to be briefly noted here is that of
disputed land grants. Under the Mexican r√©gime such
grants were generous and common, and the complicated
formalities theoretically essential to their validity
were very often, if not usually, only in part attended to. Titles
thus gained would never have been questioned under continued
Mexican government, but Americans were unaccustomed to such
riches in land and to such laxity. From the very first hundreds
&ldquo;squatted&rdquo; on large claims, contesting the title. Instead of
confirming all claims existing when the country passed to the
United States, and so ensuring an immediate settlement of the
matter, which was really the most important thing for the peace
and purse of the community, the United States government
undertook through a land commission and courts to sift the
valid from the fraudulent. Claims of enormous aggregate value
were thus considered and a large part of those dating from the
last years of Mexican dominion (many probably artfully concocted
and fraudulently antedated after the commission was at
work) were finally rejected. This litigation filled the state and
federal courts for many years. The high value of realty in
San Francisco naturally offered extraordinary inducements to
fraud, and the largest part of the city was for years involved in
fraudulent claims, and its peace broken by &ldquo;squatter&rdquo;-troubles.
Twenty or thirty years of the state&rsquo;s life were disturbed by these
controversies. Land monopoly is an evil of large proportions
in California to-day, but it is due to the laxness of the United
States government in enabling speculators to accumulate holdings
and not to the original extent of Mexican grants.</p>

<p>In state gubernatorial elections after the Civil War the
Democrats won in 1867, 1875, 1882, 1886, 1894; the Republicans
in 1871, 1879, 1890, 1898, 1902, 1906, 1910. Features of political
life and of legislation after 1876 were a strong labour agitation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
the struggle for the exclusion of the Chinese, for the control of
hydraulic mining, irrigation, and the advancement by state-aid
of the fruit interests; the last three of which have already been
referred to above. Labour conditions were peculiar in the
decade following 1870. Mining, war times and the building of
the Central Pacific had up to then inflated prices and prosperity.
Then there came a slump; probably the truth was rather that
money was becoming less unnaturally abundant than that there
was any over-supply of labour. The turning off of some 15,000
Chinese (principally in 1869-1870) from the Central Pacific lines
who flocked to San Francisco, augmented the discontent of
incompetents, of disappointed late immigrants, and the reaction
from flush times. Labour unions became strong and demonstrative.
In 1877-1878 Denis Kearney (1847-1907), an Irish
drayman and demagogue of considerable force and daring,
headed the discontented. This is called the &ldquo;sand-lots agitation&rdquo;
from the favourite meeting-place (in San Francisco) of
the agitators.</p>

<p>The outcome of these years was the Constitution of 1879,
already described, and the exclusion of Chinese by national law.
In 1879 California voted against further immigration of Chinese
by 154,638 to 883. Congress re-enacted exclusion legislation in
1902. All authorities agree that the Chinese in early years were
often abused in the mining country and their rights most unjustly
neglected by the law and its officers. Men among the
most respected in California (Joaquin Miller, H.H. Bancroft
and others) have said most in praise and defence of the Chinaman.
From railroad making to cooking he has proved his abilities
and trustworthiness. He is found to-day in the mines and
fisheries, in various lines of manufacture, in small farming, and
in all branches of domestic service. The question of the economic
development of the state, and of trade to the Orient, the views
of the mercenary labour-contractor and of the philanthropist,
the factor of &ldquo;upper-race&rdquo; repugnance, the &ldquo;economic-leech&rdquo;
argument, the &ldquo;rat-rice-filth-and-opium&rdquo; argument, have all
entered into the problem. Certain it is that though the unprejudiced
must admit that exclusion has not been at all an unmixed
blessing, yet the consensus of opinion is that a large population,
non-citizen and non-assimilable, sending&mdash;it is said&mdash;most of
their earnings to China, living in the main meanly at best, and
practically without wives, children or homes, is socially and
economically a menace outweighing the undoubted convenience
of cheaper (and frequently more trustworthy) menial labour
than the other population affords. The exclusion had much to
do with making the huge single crop ranches unprofitable and in
leading to their replacement by small farms and varied crops.
Many of the Chinese now in the state are wealthy. Race feeling
against them has become much less marked.</p>

<p>One outcome of early mission history, the &ldquo;Pious Fund of
the Californias,&rdquo; claimed in 1902 the attention of the Hague
Tribunal. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arbitration</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">International</a></span>, Hague cases
section.) In 1906-1907 there was throughout the state a remarkable
anti-Japanese agitation, centring in San Francisco
(<i>q.v.</i>) and affecting international relations and national politics.</p>

San Francisco, 1884-1890), also <i>California Pastoral, 1769-1848</i>
(San Francisco, 1888), <i>California Inter-Pocula, 1848-1856</i> (San
Francisco, 1888), and <i>Popular Tribunals</i> (2 vols., San Francisco,
1887). These volumes were largely written under Mr. Bancroft&rsquo;s
direction and control by an office staff, and are of very unequal
value; they are a vast storehouse of detailed material which is of
great usefulness, although their judgments of men are often inadequate
and prejudiced. As regards events the histories are of
substantial accuracy and adequacy. Written by one hand and
more uniform in treatment and good judgment, is T.H. Hittell&rsquo;s
<i>History of California</i> (4 vols., San Francisco, 1885-1897). The older
historian of the state was Francisco Palou, a Franciscan, the friend
and biographer of Serra; his &ldquo;Noticias de la Nueva California&rdquo;
(Mexico, 1857, in the <i>Doc. Hist. Mex.,</i> ser. iv., tom, vi.-viii.; also
San Francisco, 1874, 4 vols.) is no longer of importance save for its
historical interest. Of the contemporary material on the period
of Mexican domination the best is afforded by R.H. Dana&rsquo;s <i>Two
Years Before the Mast</i> (New York, 1840, many later and foreign
editions); also A. Robinson, <i>Life in California</i> (New York, 1846);
and Alexander Forbes, <i>California: A History of Upper and Lower
California from their First Discovery to the Present Time</i> (London,
1839); see also F.W. Blackmar, &ldquo;Spanish Institutions of the
Southwest&rdquo; (<i>Johns Hopkins University Studies,</i> 1891). A beautiful,
vivid and reputedly very accurate picture of the old society is
given in Helen Hunt Jackson&rsquo;s novel, <i>Ramona</i> (New York, 1884).
There is no really scientific separate account of mission history;
there are books by Father Z. Engelhart, <i>The Franciscans in California</i>
(Harbor Springs, Michigan, 1899), written entirely from a Franciscan
standpoint; C.F. Carter, <i>Missions of Nueva California</i> (San Francisco,
1900); Bryan J. Clinch, <i>California and its Missions: Their
History to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</i> (2 vols., San Francisco,
1904); Francisco Palou, <i>Relacion Historica de la Vida ... del Fray
Junipero Serra</i> (Mexico, 1787), the standard contemporary source;
the <i>Craftsman</i> (Syracuse, N.Y., vol. v.), a series of articles on
&ldquo;Mission Buildings,&rdquo; by G.W. James. On the case of the Pious
Fund of the missions see J.F. Doyle, <i>History of the Pious Fund</i>
(San Francisco, 1887); <i>United States Department of State,</i> &ldquo;United
States <i>v.</i> Mexico. Report of J.H. Ralston, agent of the United
States and of counsel in the matter of the Pious Fund of the Californias&rdquo;
(Washington, 1902). On the &ldquo;flush&rdquo; mining years the
best books of the time are J.Q. Thornton&rsquo;s <i>Oregon and California</i>
(2 vols., New York, 1849); Edward Bryant&rsquo;s <i>What I Saw in California</i>
(New York, 1848); W. Shaw&rsquo;s <i>Golden Dreams</i> (London, 1851);
Bayard Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Eldorado</i> (2 vols., New York, 1850); W. Colton&rsquo;s
<i>Three Years in California</i> (New York, 1850); E.G. Buffum&rsquo;s <i>Six
Months in the Gold Mines; from a Journal of Three Years&rsquo; Residence

of Military Government in Newly Acquired Territory of the United
States,&rdquo; in vol. xx. No. 2 (New York, 1904) of <i>Columbia University

<p><span class="bold">CALIFORNIA, LOWER<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> (<i>Baja California</i>), a long narrow
peninsula between the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean,
forming a territory of the republic of Mexico. Pop. (1895),
42,245; (1900) 47,624. Lower California is a southward extension
of the State of California, United States, and is touched
by only one of the Mexican states, that of Sonora on the E. The
peninsula is about 760 m. long and from 30 to 150 m. wide, and
has an area of 58,328 sq. m. It is traversed throughout its entire
length by an irregular range of barren mountains, which slopes
toward the Pacific in a succession of low hills, but breaks down
abruptly toward the Gulf. The coast has two or three good
sheltered bays, that of La Paz on the Gulf side and of Magdalena
on the Pacific side being best known. The coast is bordered
by numerous islands, especially on the eastern side. The general
appearance of the surface is arid and desolate, partly because of
the volcanic remains, and partly because of the scanty rainfall,
which is insufficient to support vegetation other than that of the
desert except in the deeper mountain valleys. The northern
part is hot and dry, like southern California, but the southern
part receives more rain and has some fertile tracts, with a mild
and pleasant climate. The principal natural product in this
region is <i>orchil</i>, or Spanish moss, but by means of irrigation the
soil produces a considerable variety of products, including sugar
cane, cotton, cassava, cereals, tobacco and grapes. Horses,
sheep and cattle are raised in the fertile valleys, but only to a
limited extent. The territory is rich in minerals, among which
are gold, silver, copper, lead, gypsum, coal and salt. The silver
mines near La Paz were worked by the Jesuits as early as 1700.
There are also extensive pearl fisheries in the Gulf, La Paz being
the headquarters of the industry, and whale fisheries on the W.
coast in the vicinity of Magdalena Bay. The development of
mining and other industries in the territory has led to an extension
of the California railway system southward into the peninsula,
with the Mexican government&rsquo;s permission, the first section of
37 m. from the northern frontier being completed and opened to
traffic in 1907. The territory is divided into two districts, the
northern having its capital at the insignificant little village of La
Ensenada, on Todos Santos Bay, and the southern having its
capital at La Paz, at the head of a deep bay opening into the Gulf.
La Paz is a port of call for steamships running between Mazatlan
and San Francisco, and had a population of 5056 in 1900. La
Ensenada (pop. in 1906, about 1500), 65 m. by sea S. of San
Diego, Cal., is the only port for the northern part of the territory,
and supplies a district extending 250 m. along the coast and 60 m.
inland, including the mining camps of the north; it manufactures
and exports flour and leather.</p>

<p>By orders of Cort√©s the coast of Lower California was explored
in 1539 by Francisco de Ulloa, but no settlement resulted. It
was called California, the name (according to E.E. Hale) being
derived from a popular Spanish romance of that time, entitled
<i>Sergas de Esplandian</i>, in which an island named California was
mentioned and situated &ldquo;on the right hand of the Indies, very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
near the terrestrial paradise.&rdquo; The name must have been given
derisively, as the barren coasts of Lower California could not
have suggested the proximity of a &ldquo;terrestrial paradise.&rdquo; The
exploration of the coast did not extend above the peninsula
until 1842. The name California was at first applied exclusively
to the peninsula; later, on the supposition that a strait connected
the Pacific with the head of the Gulf of California, the
name Islas Californias was frequently used. This erroneous
theory was held as late as 1721. The first settlement was made
in 1597, but was abandoned. From 1633 to 1683 five unsuccessful
attempts were made to establish a settlement at La Paz. Finally
the Jesuits succeeded in founding a mission at Loreto on the
Gulf coast, in about 26¬∞ N. lat., in 1697, and at La Paz in 1720.
At the time of their expulsion (1767) they had sixteen missions
which were either self-supporting or were maintained by funds
invested for that special purpose. The settlement of Upper
California began in 1769, after which the two provinces were
distinguished as California Baja or Antigua, and California Alta,
the seat of government remaining in the former for a short time.
The two provinces were separated in 1804, were united under one
governor residing in California Alta in 1825, and were then reunited
in a single department through the political changes of
1836, which lasted no later than 1847. Lower California was
only slightly disturbed by the struggle for independence among
the Spanish-American colonies, but in 1822 Admiral Lord
Cochrane, who was in the service of the Chilean revolutionists,
appeared on the coast and plundered San Jos√© del Cabo, Todos
Santos and Loreto. In the war between Mexico and the United
States La Paz and other coast towns were occupied by small
detachments from California. In 1853 a filibustering expedition
against Sonora under William Walker took possession of La Paz
and proclaimed a republic consisting of Sonora and the peninsula.
Fearing an attack from the mainland, the filibusters first withdrew
to La Ensenada, near the American frontier, and then in
the following year broke up altogether during an attempt to
invade Sonora by land. A revolution under the leadership of
Marquez de Leon in 1879 met with some temporary success, but
died for want of material support in 1880. The development
of mining and other industries since that time, together with
vigorous efforts to found colonies in the more favoured localities,
have greatly improved the situation in the territory.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALIFORNIA, UNIVERSITY OF,<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> one of the largest and most
important of state universities in America, situated at Berkeley,
California, on the E. shore of San Francisco Bay. It took the place
of the College of California (founded in 1855), received California&rsquo;s
portion of the Federal land grant of 1862, was chartered
as a state institution by the legislature in 1868, and opened its
doors in 1869 at Oakland. In 1873 it was removed to its present
site. In the revised state constitution of 1879 provision is
made for it as the head of the state&rsquo;s educational system. The
grounds at Berkeley cover 270 acres on the lower slopes (299-900
ft.) of the Berkeley Hills, which rise 1000 ft. or more above the
university; the view over the bay to San Francisco and the
Golden Gate is superb. In recent years new and better buildings
have gradually been provided. In 1896 an international architectural
competition was opened at the expense of Mrs Phoebe R.
Hearst (made a regent of the university in 1898) for plans for a
group of buildings harmonizing with the university&rsquo;s beautiful
site, and ignoring all buildings already existing. The first
prize was awarded in 1899 to Emile B√©nard, of Paris. The
first building begun under the new plans was that for the
college of mines (the gift of Mrs Hearst), completed in 1907,
providing worthily for the important school of mining, from
1885 directed by Prof. S.B. Christy (b. 1853); California Hall,
built by state appropriation, had been completed in 1906. The
Greek theatre (1903), an open-air auditorium seating 7500
spectators, on a hill-side in a grove of towering eucalypts, was
the gift of William Randolph Hearst; this has been used
regularly for concerts by the university&rsquo;s symphony orchestra,
under the professor of music, John Frederick Wolle (b. 1863),
who originated the Bach Festivals at Bethlehem, Pa.; free
public concerts are given on Sunday afternoons; and there
have been some remarkable dramatic performances here, notably
Sudraka&rsquo;s <i>Mricchakattika</i> in English, and Aeschylus&rsquo;s <i>Eumenides</i>
in Greek, in April 1907. There are no dormitories. Student
self-government works through the &ldquo;Undergraduate Students&rsquo;
Affairs Committee&rdquo; of the Associated Students. The faculty of
the university has its own social club, with a handsome building
on the grounds. At Berkeley is carried on the work in the
colleges of letters, social sciences, natural sciences, commerce,
agriculture, mechanical, mining and civil engineering, and
chemistry, and the first two years&rsquo; course of the college of
medicine&mdash;the Toland Medical College having been absorbed by
the university in 1873; at Mount Hamilton, the work of the
Lick astronomical department; and in San Francisco, that of
dentistry (1888), pharmacy, law, art, and the concluding (post
graduate or clinical) years of the medical course&mdash;the San
Francisco Polyclinic having become a part of the university in
1892. Three of the San Francisco departments occupy a group
of three handsome buildings in the western part of the city,
overlooking Golden Gate Park. The Lick astronomical department
(Lick Observatory) on Mount Hamilton, near San Jos√©,
occupies a site covering 2777 acres. It was founded in 1875 by
James Lick of San Francisco, and was endowed by him with
$700,000, $610,000 of this being used for the original buildings
and equipments, which were formally transferred to the university
in 1888. The art department (San Francisco Institute
of art) was until 1906 housed in the former home of Mark Hopkins,
a San Francisco &ldquo;railroad king&rdquo;; it dated from 1893, under
the name &ldquo;Mark Hopkins Institute of Art.&rdquo; The building was
destroyed in the San Francisco conflagration of 1906; but under
its present name the department resumed work in 1907 on the
old site. At the university farm, of nearly 750 acres, at Davisville,
Yolo county, instruction is given in practical agriculture,
horticulture, dairying, &amp;c.; courses in irrigation are given at
Berkeley; a laboratory of plant pathology, established in 1907
at Whittier, Riverside county, and an experiment station on
20 acres of land near Riverside, are for the study of plant and
tree diseases and pests and of their remedies. A marine biological
laboratory is maintained at La Jolla, near San Diego, and
another, the Hertzstein Research Laboratory, at New Monterey;
the Rudolph Spreckels Physiological Laboratory is in Berkeley.
The university has excellent anthropological and archaeological
collections, mostly made by university expeditions, endowed by
Mrs Hearst, to Peru and to Egypt. In 1907 the university
library contained 160,000 volumes, ranking, after the destruction
of most of the San Francisco libraries in 1906, as the largest
collection in the vicinity. The building of the Doe library
(given by the will of Charles Franklin Doe), for the housing of
the university library, was begun in 1907. The university has
also the valuable Bancroft collection of 50,000 volumes and
countless pamphlets and manuscripts, dealing principally with
the history of the Pacific Coast from Alaska through Central
America, and of the Rocky Mountain region, including Montana,
Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Western
Texas. This collection (that of the historian Hubert Howe
Bancroft) was acquired in 1905 for $250,000 (of which Mr
Bancroft contributed $100,000), and was entrusted (1907) to the
newly organized Academy of Pacific Coast History. The library
of Karl Weinhold (1823-1901) of Berlin, which is especially rich
in Germanic linguistics and &ldquo;culture history,&rdquo; was presented to
the university in 1903 by John D. Spreckels. The university
publishes <i>The University of California Chronicle</i>, an official
record; and there are important departmental publications,
especially those in American archaeology and ethnology, edited
by Frederic Ward Putnam (b. 1839), including the reports of
various expeditions, maintained by Mrs Hearst; in physiology,
edited by Jacques Loeb (b. 1859); in botany, edited
by William Albert Setchell (b. 1864); in zoology, edited by
William Emerson Ritter (b. 1859); and in astronomy, the
publications of the Lick Observatory, edited by William Wallace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>
Campbell (b. 1862). In 1902, under the direction of Henry
Morse Stephens (b. 1857), who then became professor of
history, a department of university extension was organized;
lecture courses, especially on history and literature, were delivered
in 1906-1907 at fifteen extension &ldquo;centres,&rdquo; at most of
which classes of study were formed. Annexes to the university,
but having no corporate connexion with it, are the Berkeley
Bible Seminary (Disciples of Christ), the Pacific Theological
Seminary (Congregational), the Pacific Coast Baptist Seminary
and a Unitarian school.</p>

<p>The growth of the university has been extremely rapid. From
1890 to 1900 the number of students increased fourfold. In
the latter year the university of California was second to Harvard
only in the number of academic graduate and undergraduate
students, and fifth among the educational institutions of the
country in total enrolment. In July 1907 there were 519
officers in the faculties and 2987 students, of whom 226 were in
the professional schools in San Francisco. In addition there
were 707 students in the 1906 summer session, the total for
1906-1907 thus being 3684; of this number 1506 were women.
The university conferred 482 degrees in 1907, 546 in 1906, 470 in
1905. The affairs of the university are administered by a board
of twenty-three regents, seven state officials and heads of
educational institutions, being members <i>ex officio</i>, and sixteen
other members being appointed by the governor and senate of
the state; its instruction is governed by the faculties of the
different colleges, and an academic senate in which these are
joined. The gross income from all sources for 1905-1906 was
$1,564,190, of which about $800,000 was income from investments,
state and government grants, fees, &amp;c., and the remainder
was gifts and endowments. There is a permanent endowment of
more than $3,000,000, partly from munificent private gifts,
especially from Mrs Hearst and from Miss Cora Jean Flood. The
financial support of the state has always been generous. No
tuition fee is charged in the academic colleges to students
resident in the state, and only $10.00 annually to students from
without the state. The university maintains about 90 undergraduate
scholarships, and 10 graduate scholarships and fellowships.
All able-bodied male students are required to take the
courses in military science, under instruction by an officer of the
United States army detailed for the purpose. Physical culture
and hygiene are prescribed for all men and women. A state law
forbids the sale of liquor within one mile of the university
grounds. To realize the ideal of the university as the head of the
educational system of the state, a system of inspection of high
schools has been developed, whereby schools reaching the prescribed
standard are entitled to recommend their graduates for
admission to the university without examination. It was
anticipated at one time that the foundation of the Leland
Stanford Junior University at Palo Alto would injure the state
institution at Berkeley; but in practice this was not found to
be the case; on the contrary, the competition resulted in giving
new vigour and enterprise to the older university. Joseph Le
Conte (professor from 1872 to 1901) and Daniel C. Oilman
(president in 1872-1875) deserve mention among those formerly
connected with the university. In 1899 Benjamin Ide Wheeler
(b. 1854) became president. He had been a graduate (1875)
of Brown University, and was professor first of comparative
philology and then of Greek at Cornell University; his chief
publications are <i>Der griechische Nominalaccent</i> (1885); <i>Analogy,
and the Scope of its Application in Language</i> (1887); <i>Principles of
Language Growth</i> (1891); <i>The Organization of Higher Education
in the United States</i> (1897); <i>Dionysos and Immortality</i> (1899);
and <i>Life of Alexander the Great</i> (1900).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALIPH<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span>, <span class="sc">Calif</span>, or <span class="sc">Khalif</span> (Arab, <i>kh&#259;l&#299;fa</i>; the lengthening
of the a is strictly incorrect), literally &ldquo;successor,&rdquo; &ldquo;representative,&rdquo;
a title borne originally by Abu Bekr, who, on the
death of Mahomet, became the civil and religious head of the
Mahommedan state. In the same sense the term is used in the
Koran of both Adam and David as the vicegerents of God.
Abu Bekr and his three (or four) immediate successors are known
as the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; caliphs; after them the title was borne by the
thirteen Omayyad caliphs of Damascus, and subsequently by
the thirty-seven Abbasid caliphs of Bagdad whose dynasty fell
before the Turks in 1258. By some rigid Moslems these rulers
were regarded as only amirs, not caliphs. There were titular
caliphs of Abbasid descent in Egypt from that date till 1517
when the last caliph was captured by Selim I. On the fall of the
Omayyad dynasty at Damascus, the title was assumed by the
Spanish branch of the family who ruled in Spain at Cordova
(755-1031), and the Fatimite rulers of Egypt, who pretended
to descent from Ali, and Fatima, Mahomet&rsquo;s daughter, also
assumed the name (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fatimites</a></span>).</p>

<p>According to the Shi&lsquo;ite Moslems, who call the office the
&ldquo;imamate&rdquo; or leadership, no caliph is legitimate unless he is
a lineal descendant of the Prophet. The Sunnites insist that the
office belongs to the tribe of Koreish (Quraish) to which Mahomet
himself belonged, but this condition would vitiate the claim of
the Turkish sultans, who have held the office since its transference
by the last caliph to Selim I. According to a tradition
falsely ascribed to Mahomet, there can be but one caliph at a
time; should a second be set up, he must be killed, for he &ldquo;is
a rebel.&rdquo; (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan Institutions</a></span>.)</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">A.&mdash;The First Four Caliphs</p>

<p>After the death of Mahomet the question arose who was to be
his &ldquo;representative.&rdquo; The choice lay with the community of
Medina; so much was understood; but whom were they to
choose? The natives of Medina believed themselves to be now
once more masters in their own house, and wished to promote
one of themselves. But the Emigrants (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahomet</a></span>) asserted
their opposing claims, and with success, having brought into
the town a considerable number of outside Moslems, so as to
terrorize the men of Medina, who besides were still divided into
two parties. The Emigrants&rsquo; leading spirit was Omar; he did
not, however, cause homage to be paid to himself, but to Abu
Bekr, the friend and father-in-law of the Prophet.</p>

<p>The affair would not have gone on so smoothly, had not the
opportune defection of the Arabians put a stop to the inward
schism which threatened. Islam suddenly found itself once
more limited to the community of Medina; only Mecca and
T&#257;if (T&#257;yef) remained true. The Bedouins were willing enough
to pray, indeed, but less willing to pay taxes; their defection,
as might have been expected, was a political movement.<a name="fa2b" id="fa2b" href="#ft2b"><span class="sp">2</span></a> None
the less was it a revolt from Islam, for here the political society
and the religious are identical. A peculiar compliment to
Mahomet was involved in the fact that the leaders of the rebellion
in the various districts did not pose as princes and kings, but as
prophets; in this appeared to lie the secret of Islam&rsquo;s success.</p>

<p>1. <i>Reign of Abu Bekr</i>.&mdash;Abu Bekr proved himself quite equal
to the perilous situation. In the first place, he allowed the
expedition against the Greeks, already arranged by Mahomet,
quietly to set out, limiting himself for the time to the defence
of Medina. On the return of the army he proceeded to attack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>
the rebels. The holy spirit of Islam kept the men of Medina
together, and inspired in them an all-absorbing zeal for the
faith; the Arabs as a whole had no other bond of union and no
better source of inspiration than individual interest. As was
to be expected, they were worsted; eleven small flying columns
of the Moslems, sent out in various directions, sufficed to quell
the revolt. Those who submitted were forthwith received back
into favour; those who persevered in rebellion were punished
with death. The majority accordingly converted, the obstinate
were extirpated. In Yamama (Yemama) only was there a
severe struggle; the Ban&#363; Han&#299;fa under their prophet Mosailima
fought bravely, but here also Islam triumphed.</p>

<p>The internal consolidation of Islam in Arabia was, strange to
say, brought about by its diffusion abroad. The holy war
against the border countries which Mahomet had already
inaugurated, was the best means for making the new religion
popular among the Arabs, for opportunity was at the same
time afforded for gaining rich booty. The movement was
organized by Islam, but the masses were induced to join it by
quite other than religious motives. Nor was this by any means
the first occasion on which the Arabian cauldron had overflowed;
once and again in former times emigrant swarms of Bedouins
had settled on the borders of the wilderness. This had last
happened in consequence of the events which destroyed the
prosperity of the old Sabaean kingdom. At that time the small
Arabian kingdoms of Ghass&#257;n and Hira had arisen in the western
and eastern borderlands of cultivation; these now presented
to Moslem conquest its nearest and natural goal. But inasmuch
as Hira was subject to the Persians, and Eastern Palestine to
the Greeks, the annexation of the Arabians involved the extension
of the war beyond the limits of Arabia to a struggle with
the two great powers (see further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arabia</a></span>: <i>History</i>).</p>

<p>After the subjugation of middle and north-eastern Arabia,
Kh&#257;lid b. al-Wal&#299;d proceeded by order of the caliph to the
conquest of the districts on the lower Euphrates. Thence he
was summoned to Syria, where hostilities had also broken out.
Damascus fell late in the summer of 635, and on the 20th of
August 636 was fought the great decisive battle on the Hieromax
(Yarmuk), which caused the emperor Heraclius (<i>q.v.</i>) finally to
abandon Syria.<a name="fa3b" id="fa3b" href="#ft3b"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Left to themselves, the Christians henceforward
defended themselves only in isolated cases in the fortified
cities; for the most part they witnessed the disappearance of
the Byzantine power without regret. Meanwhile the war was
also carried on against the Persians in Irak, unsuccessfully at
first, until the tide turned at the battle of Kadisiya (Kadessia,
Q&#257;dis&#299;ya) (end of 637). In consequence of the defeat which
they here sustained, the Persians were forced to abandon the
western portion of their empire and limit themselves to Iran
proper. The Moslems made themselves masters of Ctesiphon
(Mad&#257;in), the residence of the Sassanids on the Tigris, and
conquered in the immediately following years the country of
the two rivers. In 639 the armies of Syria and Irak were face
to face in Mesopotamia. In a short time they had taken from
the Aryans all the principal old Semitic lands&mdash;Palestine, Syria,
Mesopotamia, Assyria and Babylonia. To these was soon added
Egypt, which was overrun with little difficulty by &lsquo;Amr ibn-el-Ass
(<i>q.v.</i>) in 640. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Egypt</a></span>: <i>History</i>, ¬ß Mahommedan.)
This completed the circle of the lands bordering on the wilderness
of Arabia; within these limits annexation was practicable and
natural, a repetition indeed of what had often previously occurred.
The kingdoms of Ghassan and Hira, advanced posts
hitherto, now became the headquarters of the Arabs; the new
empire had its centres on the one hand at Damascus, on the
other hand at Kufa and Ba&#7779;ra, the two newly-founded cities in
the region of old Babylonia. The capital of Islam continued
indeed for a while to be Medina, but soon the Hejaz (Hijaz) and
the whole of Arabia proper lay quite on the outskirt of affairs.</p>

<p>The ease with which the native populations of the conquered
districts, exclusively or prevailingly Christian, adapted
themselves to the new rule is very striking. Their nationality had
been broken long ago, but intrinsically it was more closely allied
to the Arabian than to the Greek or Persian. Their religious
sympathy with the West was seriously impaired by dogmatic
controversies; from Islam they might at any rate hope for
toleration, even though their views were not in accordance
with the theology of the emperor of the day. The lapse of the
masses from Christianity to Islam, however, which took place
during the first century after the conquest, is to be accounted
for only by the fact that in reality they had no inward relation
to the gospel at all. They changed their creed merely to acquire
the rights and privileges of Moslem citizens. In no case were
they compelled to do so; indeed the Omayyad caliphs saw
with displeasure the diminishing proceeds of the poll-tax derived
from their Christian subjects (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan Institutions</a></span>).</p>

<p>It would have been a great advantage for the solidity of the
Arabian empire if it had confined itself within the limits of those
old Semitic lands, with perhaps the addition of Egypt. But the
Persians were not so ready as the Greeks to give up the contest;
they did not rest until the Moslems had subjugated the whole
of the Sassanid empire. The most important event in the
protracted war which led to the conquest of Iran, was the battle
of Neh&#257;wend in 641;<a name="fa4b" id="fa4b" href="#ft4b"><span class="sp">4</span></a> the most obstinate resistance was offered
by Persis proper, and especially by the capital, Istakhr (Persepolis).
In the end, all the numerous and partly autonomous
provinces of the Sassanid empire fell, one after the other, into
the hands of the Moslems, and the young king, Yazdegerd III.
(<i>q.v.</i>), was compelled to retire to the farthest corner of his realm,
where he came to a miserable end.<a name="fa5b" id="fa5b" href="#ft5b"><span class="sp">5</span></a> But it was long before the
Iranians learned to accept the situation. Unlike the Christians
of western Asia, they had a vigorous feeling of national pride,
based upon glorious memories and especially upon a church
having a connexion of the closest kind with the state. Internal
disturbances of a religious and political character and external
disasters had long ago shattered the empire of the Sassanids
indeed, but the Iranians had not yet lost their patriotism. They
were fighting, in fact, against the despised and hated Arabs,
in defence of their holiest possessions, their nationality and
their faith. Their subjection was only external, nor did Islam
ever succeed in assimilating them as the Syrian Christians were
assimilated. Even when in process of time they did accept the
religion of the prophet, they leavened it thoroughly with their
own peculiar leaven, and, especially, deprived it of the practical
political and national character which it had assumed after the
flight to Medina. To the Arabian state they were always a
thorn in the flesh; it was they who helped most to break up its
internal order, and it was from them also that it at last received
its outward death-blow. The fall of the Omayyads was their
work, and with the Omayyads fell the Arabian empire.</p>

<p>2. <i>Reign of Omar</i>.&mdash;Abu Bekr died after a short reign on the
22nd of August 634, and as a matter of course was succeeded by
Omar. To Omar&rsquo;s ten years&rsquo; Caliphate belong for the most part
the great conquests. He himself did not take the field, but
remained in Medina with the exception of his visit to Syria in
638; he never, however, suffered the reins to slip from his
grasp, so powerful was the influence of his personality and the
Moslem community of feeling. His political insight is shown
by the fact that he endeavoured to limit the indefinite extension
of Moslem conquest, to maintain and strengthen the national
Arabian character of the commonwealth of Islam,<a name="fa6b" id="fa6b" href="#ft6b"><span class="sp">6</span></a> and especially
to promote law and order in its internal affairs. The saying
with which he began his reign will never grow antiquated:
&ldquo;by Allah, he that is weakest among you shall be in my sight
the strongest, until I have vindicated for him his rights; but
him that is strongest will I treat as the weakest, until he complies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span>
with the laws.&rdquo; After the administration of justice he directed
his organizing activity, as the circumstances demanded, chiefly
towards financial questions&mdash;the incidence of taxation in the
conquered territories,<a name="fa7b" id="fa7b" href="#ft7b"><span class="sp">7</span></a> and the application of the vast resources
which poured into the treasury at Medina. It must not be brought
against him as a personal reproach, that in dealing with these
he acted on the principle that the Moslems were the chartered
plunderers of all the rest of the world. But he had to atone by
his death for the fault of his system. In the mosque at Medina
he was stabbed by a Kufan workman and died in November 644.</p>

<p>3. <i>Reign of Othman.</i>&mdash;Before his death Omar had nominated
six of the leading Mohajir (Emigrants) who should choose the
caliph from among themselves&mdash;Othman, Ali, Zobair, &#7788;al&#7717;a,
Sa&lsquo;d b. Abi Waqq&#257;&#7779;, and Abdarra&#7717;m&#257;n b. Auf. The last-named
declined to be a candidate, and decided the election in favour
of Othman. Under this weak sovereign the government of
Islam fell entirely into the hands of the Koreish nobility. We
have already seen that Mahomet himself prepared the way for
this transference; Abu Bekr and Omar likewise helped it; the
Emigrants were unanimous among themselves in thinking that
the precedence and leadership belonged to them as of right.
Thanks to the energy of Omar, they were successful in
appropriating to themselves the succession to the Prophet. They
indeed rested their claims on the undeniable priority of their
services to the faith, but they also appealed to their blood
relationship with the Prophet as a corroboration of their right
to the inheritance; and the ties of blood connected them with
the Koreish in general. In point of fact they felt a closer
connexion with these than, for example, with the natives of Medina;
nature had not been expelled by faith.<a name="fa8b" id="fa8b" href="#ft8b"><span class="sp">8</span></a> The supremacy of the
Emigrants naturally furnished the means of transition to the
supremacy of the Meccan aristocracy. Othman did all in his
power to press forward this development of affairs. He belonged
to the foremost family of Mecca, the Omayyads, and that he
should favour his relations and the Koreish as a whole, in every
possible way, seemed to him a matter of course. Every position
of influence and emolument was assigned to them; they themselves
boastingly called the important province of Irak the garden
of Koreish. In truth, the entire empire had become that garden.
Nor was it unreasonable that from the secularization of Islam
the chief advantage should be reaped by those who best knew
the world. Such were beyond all doubt the patricians of Mecca,
and after them those of T&#257;if, people like Kh&#257;lid b. al-Wal&#299;d,
Amr-ibn-el-Ass, &lsquo;Abdall&#257;h b. ab&#299; Sar&#7717;, Mogh&#299;ra b. Sho&rsquo;ba, and,
above all, old Abu Sofi&#257;n with his son Moawiya.</p>

<p>Against the rising tide of worldliness an opposition, however,
now began to appear. It was led by what may be called the
spiritual noblesse of Islam, which, as distinguished from the
hereditary nobility of Mecca, might also be designated as the
nobility of merit, consisting of the &ldquo;Defenders&rdquo; (<i>Ansar</i>), and
especially of the Emigrants who had lent themselves to the
elevation of the Koreish, but by no means with the intention
of allowing themselves thereby to be effaced. The opposition
was headed by Ali, Zobair, &#7788;al&#7717;a, both as leading men among
the Emigrants and as disappointed candidates for the Caliphate.
Their motives were purely selfish; not God&rsquo;s cause but their
own, not religion but power and preferment, were what they
sought.<a name="fa9b" id="fa9b" href="#ft9b"><span class="sp">9</span></a> Their party was a mixed one. To it belonged the men
of real piety, who saw with displeasure the promotion to the
first places in the commonwealth of the great lords who had
actually done nothing for Islam, and had joined themselves to
it only at the last moment. But the majority were merely a band
of men without views, whose aim was a change not of system,
but of persons in their own interest. Everywhere in the provinces
there was agitation against the caliph and his governors,
except in Syria, where Othman&rsquo;s cousin, Moawiya, son of Abu
Sofi&#257;n (see below), carried on a wise and strong administration.
The movement was most energetic in Irak and in Egypt. Its
ultimate aim was the deposition of Othman in favour of Ali,
whose own services as well as his close relationship to the Prophet
seemed to give him the best claim to the Caliphate. Even then
there were enthusiasts who held him to be a sort of Messiah.</p>

<p>The malcontents sought to gain their end by force. In bands
they came from the provinces to Medina to wring concessions
from Othman, who, though his armies were spreading terror
from the Indus and Oxus to the Atlantic, had no troops at hand
in Medina. He propitiated the mutineers by concessions, but as
soon as they had gone, he let matters resume their old course.
Thus things went on from bad to worse. In the following year
(656) the leaders of the rebels came once more from Egypt and
Irak to Medina with a more numerous following; and the caliph
again tried the plan of making promises which he did not intend
to keep. But the rebels caught him in a flagrant breach of his
word,<a name="fa10b" id="fa10b" href="#ft10b"><span class="sp">10</span></a> and now demanded his abdication, besieging him in his own
house, where he was defended by a few faithful subjects. As he
would not yield, they at last took the building by storm and put
him to death, an old man of eighty. His death in the act of
maintaining his rights was of the greatest service to his house and
of corresponding disadvantage to the enemy.</p>

<p>4. <i>Reign of Ali.</i>&mdash;Controversy as to the inheritance at once
arose among the leaders of the opposition. The mass of the
mutineers summoned Ali to the Caliphate, and compelled even
&#7788;al&#7717;a and Zobair to do him homage. But soon these two,
along with Ayesha, the mother of the faithful, who had an old
grudge against Ali, succeeded in making their escape to Irak,
where at Ba&#7779;ra they raised the standard of rebellion. Ali in
point of fact had no real right to the succession, and moreover
was apparently actuated not by piety but by ambition and the
desire of power, so that men of penetration, even although they
condemned Othman&rsquo;s method of government, yet refused to
recognize his successor. The new caliph, however, found means
of disposing of their opposition, and at the battle of the Camel,
fought at Ba&#7779;ra in November 656, &#7788;al&#7717;a and Zobair were slain,
and Ayesha was taken prisoner.</p>

<p>But even so Ali had not secured peace. With the murder of
Othman the dynastic principle gained the twofold advantage of a
legitimate cry&mdash;that of vengeance for the blood of the grey-haired
caliph and a distinguished champion, the governor Moawiya,
whose position in Syria was impregnable. The kernel of his
subjects consisted of genuine Arabs, not only recent immigrants
along with Islam, but also old settlers who, through contact
with the Roman empire and the Christian church, had become to
some extent civilized. Through the Ghassanids these latter
had become habituated to monarchical government and loyal
obedience, and for a long time much better order had prevailed
amongst them than elsewhere in Arabia. Syria was the proper
soil for the rise of an Arabian kingdom, and Moawiya was just
the man to make use of the situation. He exhibited Othman&rsquo;s
blood-stained garment in the mosque at Damascus, and incited
his Syrians to vengeance.</p>

<p>Ali&rsquo;s position in Kufa was much less advantageous. The
population of Irak was already mixed up with Persian elements; it
fluctuated greatly, and was largely composed of fresh immigrants.
Islam had its headquarters here; Kufa and Ba&#7779;ra were the home
of the pious and of the adventurer, the centres of religious and
political movement. This movement it was that had raised Ali
to the Caliphate, but yet it did not really take any personal
interest in him. Religion proved for him a less trustworthy and
more dangerous support than did the conservative and secular
feeling of Syria for the Omayyads. Moawiya could either
act or refrain from acting as he chose, secure in either case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>
of the obedience of his subjects. Ali, on the other hand, was
unable to convert enthusiasm for the principle inscribed on his
banner into enthusiasm for his person. It was necessary that
he should accommodate himself to the wishes of his supporters,
which, however, were inconsistent. They compelled him
suddenly to break off the battle of Siffin, which he was apparently
on the point of gaining over Moawiya, because the Syrians
fastened copies of the Koran to their lances to denote that not
the sword, but the word of God should decide the contest (see
further below, B.1; also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ali</a></span>). But in yielding to the will of the
majority he excited the displeasure of the minority, the genuine
zealots, who in Moawiya were opposing the enemy of Islam,
and regarded Ali&rsquo;s entering into negotiations with him as a
denial of the faith. When the negotiations failed and war was
resumed, the Kharijites refused to follow Ali&rsquo;s army, and he had
to turn his armies in the first instance against them. He
succeeded in disposing of them without difficulty at the battle of
Nahraw&#257;n, but in his success he lost the soul of his following.
For they were the true champions of the theocratic principle;
through their elimination it became clear that the struggle had in
no sense anything to do with the cause of God. Ali&rsquo;s defeat was
a foregone conclusion, once religious enthusiasm had failed him;
the secular resources at the disposal of his adversaries were far
superior. Fortunately for him he was murdered (end of January
661), thereby posthumously attaining an importance in the eyes
of a large part of the Mahommedan world (Sh&#299;&lsquo;a) which he had
never possessed during his life.</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">B.&mdash;The Omayyad Dynasty</p>

<p><i>Summary of Preceding Movements.</i>&mdash;The conquest of Mecca had
been of the greatest importance to the Prophet, not only because
Islam thus obtained possession of this important city with its
famous sanctuary, but above all because his late adversaries
were at last compelled to acknowledge him as the Envoy of God.
Among these there were many men of great ability and influence,
and he was so eager to conciliate them or, as the Arabic expression
has it, &ldquo;to mellow their hearts&rdquo; by concessions and
gifts, that his loyal helpers (<i>Ansar</i>) at Medina became dissatisfied
and could only with difficulty be brought to acquiesce in it.
Mahomet was a practical man; he realized that the growing
state needed skilful administrators, and that such were found in
much greater number among the antagonists of yesterday than
among the honest citizens of Medina. The most important
positions, such as the governorships of Mecca and Yemen, were
entrusted to men of the Omayyad house, or that of the Makhz&#363;m
and other Koreishite families. Abu Bekr followed the Prophet&rsquo;s
example. In the great revolt of the Arabic tribes after the
death of Mahomet, and in the invasion of Irak and Syria by the
Moslems, the principal generals belonged to them. Omar did
not deviate from that line of conduct. It was he who appointed
Yaz&#299;d, the son of Abu Sofi&#257;n, and after his death, his brother
Moawiya as governor of Syria, and assigned the province of Egypt
to Amr-ibn-el-Ass (&lsquo;Amr b. &#256;&#7779;). It is even surprising to find
among the leading men so few of the house of H&#257;shim, the nearest
family of the Prophet. The puzzled Moslem doctors explain
this fact on the ground that the Hashimites were regarded as too
noble to hold ordinary administrative offices, and that they
could not be spared at Medina, where their counsel was required
in all important affairs. There is, however, a tradition in which
Ali himself calls the Omayyads born rulers. As long as Omar
lived opposition was silent. But Othman had not the strong
personality of his predecessor, and, although he practically
adhered to the policy of Omar, he was accused of favouring the
members of his own family&mdash;the caliph belonged himself to the
house of Omayya&mdash;at the expense of the Hashimites and the Ansar.
The jealousy of the latter two was prompted by the fact that the
governorship and military commands had become not only much
more important, but also much more lucrative, while power and
money again procured many adherents. The truly devout
Moslems on the other hand were scandalized by the growing
luxury which relaxed the austere morals of the first Moslems,
and this also was imputed to Othman.</p>

<p>We thus see how the power of the house of Omayya developed
itself, and how there arose against it an opposition, which led in
the first place to the murder of Othman and the Caliphate of Ali,
and furthermore, during the whole period of the Omayyad
caliphs, repeatedly to dangerous outbreaks, culminating in the
great catastrophe which placed the Abbasids on the throne.
The elements of this opposition were of very various kinds:&mdash;(1)
The old-fashioned Moslems, sons of the <i>Ansar</i> and <i>Moh&#257;jir</i>,
who had been Mahomet&rsquo;s first companions and supporters, and
could not bear the thought that the sons of the old enemies of the
Prophet in Mecca, whom they nicknamed <i>&#7789;olaq&#257;</i> (freedmen),
should be in control of the imamate, which carried with it the
management of affairs both civil and religious. This party was
in the foreground, chiefly in the first period. (2) The partisans
of Ali, the Shi&lsquo;a (Shi&lsquo;ites), who in proportion as their influence
with the Arabs declined, contrived to strengthen it by obtaining
the support of the non-Arabic Moslems, aided thereto, especially
in the latter period, by the Abbasids, who at the decisive
moment succeeded in seizing the supreme power for themselves.
(3) The Kharijites, who, in spite of the heavy losses they sustained
at the hands of Ali, maintained their power by gaining
new adherents from among those austere Moslems, who held both
Omayyads and Alids as usurpers, and have often been called, not
unjustly, the Puritans of Islam. (4) The non-Arabic Moslems,
who on their conversion to Islam, had put themselves under the
patronage of Arabic families, and were therefore called maula&rsquo;s
(clients). These were not only the most numerous, but also, in
virtue of the persistency of their hostility, the most dangerous.
The largest and strongest group of these were the Persians, who,
before the conquest of Irak by the Moslems, were the ruling class
of that country, so that Persian was the dominant language.
With them all malcontents, in particular the Shi&lsquo;ites, found
support; by them the dynasty of the Omayyads and the
supremacy of the Arabs was finally overthrown. To these
elements of discord we must add:&mdash;(1) That the Arabs, notwithstanding
the bond of Islam that united them, maintained their
old tribal institutions, and therewith their old feuds and factions;
(2) that the old antagonism between Ma&lsquo;adites<a name="fa11b" id="fa11b" href="#ft11b"><span class="sp">11</span></a> (original
northern tribes) and Yemenites (original southern tribes),
accentuated by the jealousy between the Meccans, who belonged
to the former, and the Medinians, who belonged to the latter
division, gave rise to perpetual conflicts; (3) that more than one
dangerous pretender&mdash;some  of them of the reigning family
itself&mdash;contended with the caliph for the sovereignty, and must
be crushed <i>co√ªte que co√ªte</i>. It is only by the detailed enumeration
of these opposing forces that we can form an idea of the
heavy task that lay before the Prince of the Believers, and of the
amount of tact and ability which his position demanded.</p>

<p>The description of the reign of the Omayyads is extremely
difficult. Never perhaps has the system of undermining
authority by continual slandering been applied on such a scale as
by the Alids and the Abbasids. The Omayyads were accused by
their numerous missionaries of every imaginable vice; in their
hands Islam was not safe; it would be a godly work to extirpate
them from the earth. When the Abbasids had occupied the
throne, they pursued this policy to its logical conclusion. But
not content with having exterminated the hated rulers themselves,
they carried their hostility to a further point. The official
history of the Omayyads, as it has been handed down to us, is
coloured by Abbasid feeling to such an extent that we can
scarcely distinguish the true from the false. An example of this
occurs at the outset in the assertion that Moawiya deliberately
refrained from marching to the help of Othman, and indeed that
it was with secret joy that he heard of the fatal result of the plot.
The facts seem to contradict this view. When, ten weeks before
the murder, some hundreds of men came to Medina from Egypt
and Irak, pretending that they were on their pilgrimage to Mecca,
but wanted to bring before the caliph their complaints against
his vicegerents, nobody could have the slightest suspicion that
the life of the caliph was in danger; indeed it was only during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span>
the few days that Othman was besieged in his house that the
danger became obvious. If the caliph then, as the chroniclers
tell, sent a message to Moawiya for help, his messenger could not
have accomplished half the journey to Damascus when the
catastrophe took place. There is no real reason to doubt that
the painful news fell on Moawiya unexpectedly, and that he, as
mightiest representative of the Omayyad house, regarded as his
own the duty of avenging the crime. He could not but view Ali
in the light of an accomplice, because if, as he protested, he did
not abet the murderers, yet he took them under his protection. An
acknowledgment of Ali as caliph by Moawiya before he had
cleared himself from suspicion was therefore quite impossible.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Reign of Moawiya.</i>&mdash;Moawiya, son of the well-known
Meccan chief Abu Sofi&#257;n, embraced Islam together with his father
and his brother Yazid, when the Prophet conquered Mecca, and
was, like them, treated with the greatest distinction. He was even
chosen to be one of the secretaries of Mahomet. When Abu Bekr
sent his troops for the conquest of Syria, Yazid, the eldest son of
Abu Sofi&#257;n, held one of the chief commands, with Moawiya as
his lieutenant. In the year 639 Omar named him governor of
Damascus and Palestine; Othman added to this province the
north of Syria and Mesopotamia. To him was committed the
conduct of the war against the Byzantine emperor, which he
continued with energy, at first only on land, but later, when the
caliph had at last given in to his urgent representations, at sea
also. In the year 34 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 655) was fought off the coast of Lycia
the great naval battle, which because of the great number of
masts has been called &ldquo;the mast fight,&rdquo; in which the Greek<a name="fa12b" id="fa12b" href="#ft12b"><span class="sp">12</span></a>
fleet, commanded by the emperor Constans II. in person, was
utterly defeated. Moawiya himself was not present, as he was
conducting an attack (the result of which we do not know) on
Caesarea in Cappadocia. The Arabic historians are so entirely
preoccupied with the internal events that they have no eye for
the war at the frontier. The contention which Moawiya had
with Ali checked his progress in the north.</p>

<p>Moawiya was a born ruler, and Syria was, as we have seen, the
best administered province of the whole empire. He was so
loved and honoured by his Syrians that, when he invited them
to avenge the blood of Othman, they replied unanimously, &ldquo;It is
your part to command, ours to obey.&rdquo; Ali was a valiant man,
but had no great talent as a ruler. His army numbered a great
many enthusiastic partisans, but among them not a few wise-acres;
there were also others of doubtful loyalty. The battle at
Siffin (657), near the Euphrates, which lasted two months and
consisted principally in, sometimes bloody, skirmishes, with
alternate success, ended by the well-known appeal to the decision
of the Koran on the part of Moawiya. This appeal has been called
by a European scholar &ldquo;one of the unworthiest comedies of the
whole world&rsquo;s history,&rdquo; accepting the report of very partial
Arabic writers that it happened when the Syrians were on the
point of losing the battle. He forgot that Ali himself, before the
Battle of the Camel, appealed likewise to the decision of the
Koran, and began the fight only when this had been rejected.
There is in reality no room for suspecting Moawiya of not having
been in earnest when making this appeal; he might well regret
that internecine strife should drain the forces which were so
much wanted for the spread of Islam. That the Book of God
could give a solution, even of this arduous case, was doubtless the
firm belief of both parties. But even if the appeal to the Koran
had been a stratagem, as Ali himself thought, it would have been
perfectly legitimate, according to the general views of that time,
which had been also those of the Prophet. It is not unlikely
that the chief leader of the Yemenites in Ali&rsquo;s army, Ash&lsquo;ath b.
Qais, knew beforehand that this appeal would be made. Certainty
is not to be obtained in the whole matter.</p>

<p>On each side an umpire was appointed, Abu M&#363;s&#257;a al-Ash&lsquo;ar&#299;,
the candidate of Ash&lsquo;ath, on that of Ali, Amr-ibn-el-Ass (<i>q.v.</i>) on
that of Moawiya. The arbitrators met in the year 37 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 658)
at Adhroh, in the south-east of Syria, where are the ruins of
the Roman Castra described by Br√ºnnow and Domaszewsky
(<i>Die Provincio Arabia,</i> i. 433-463). Instead of this place, the
historians generally put D&#363;mat-al-Jandal, the biblical Duma,
now called Jauf, but this rests on feeble authority. The various
accounts about what happened in this interview are without
exception untrustworthy. J. Wellhausen, in his excellent book
<i>Das arabische Reich und sein Sturz,</i> has made it very probable that
the decision of the umpires was that the choice of Ali as caliph
should be cancelled, and that the task of nominating a successor
to Othman should be referred to the council of notable men
(<i>sh&#363;r&#257;</i>), as representing the whole community. Ali refusing to
submit to this decision, Moawiya became the champion of the
law, and thereby gained at once considerable support for the
conquest of Egypt, to which above all he directed his efforts. As
soon as Amr returned from Adhroh, Moawiya sent him with an
army of four or five thousand men against Egypt. About the
same time the constitutional party rose against Ali&rsquo;s vicegerent
Mahommed, son of Abu Bekr, who had been the leader of the
murderous attack on Othman. Mahommed was beaten, taken
in his flight, and, according to some reports, sewn in the skin of an
ass and burned.</p>

<p>Moawiya, realizing that Ali would take all possible means to
crush him, took his measures accordingly. He concluded with
the Greeks a treaty, by which he pledged himself to pay a large
sum of money annually on condition that the emperor should give
him hostages as a pledge for the maintenance of peace. Ali,
however, had first to deal with the insurrection of the Kharijites,
who condemned the arbitration which followed the battle of Siffin
as a deed of infidelity, and demanded that Ali should break the
compact (see above, A.4). Freed from this difficulty, Ali prepared
to direct his march against Moawiya, but his soldiers declined to
move. One of his men, Khirr&#299;t b. R&#257;shid, renounced him
altogether, because he had not submitted to the decision of the
umpires, and persuaded many others to refuse the payment of the
poor-rate. Ali was obliged to subdue him, a task which he
effected not without difficulty. Not a few of his former partisans
went over to Moawiya, as already had happened before the days
of Siffin, amongst others Ali&rsquo;s own brother &lsquo;Aq&#299;l. Lastly, there
were in Kufa, and still more in Basra, many Othmaniya or
legitimists, on whose co-operation he could not rely. Moawiya
from his side made incessant raids into Ali&rsquo;s dominion, and by his
agents caused a very serious revolt in Basra. The statement that
a treaty was concluded between Moawiya and Ali to maintain the
<i>status quo</i>, in the beginning of the year 40 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 660), is not very
probable, for it is pretty certain that just then Ali had raised an
army of 40,000 men against the Syrians, and also that in the second
or third month of that year Moawiya was proclaimed caliph at
Jerusalem. At the same time Bosr b. Abi Art&#257;t made his
expedition against Medina and Mecca, whose inhabitants were
compelled to acknowledge the caliphate of Moawiya. On the
murder of Ali in 661, his son Hasan was chosen caliph, but he
recoiled before the prospect of a war with Moawiya, having
neither the ambition nor the energy of Ali. Moawiya stood then
with a large army in Maskin, a rich district lying to the north of
the later West Bagdad, watered by the Dojail, or Little Tigris, a
channel from the Euphrates to the Tigris. The army of Trak was
near Mad&#257;in, the ancient Ctesiphon. The reports about what
occurred are confused and contradictory; but it seems probable
that Abdallah b. Abbas, the vicegerent of Ali at Basra and
ancestor of the future Abbasid dynasty, was in command. No
battle was fought. Hasan and Ibn Abbas opened, each for
himself, negotiations with Moawiya. The latter made it a
condition of surrender that he should have the free disposal of the
funds in the treasury of Basra. Some say that he had already
before the death of Ali rendered himself master of it. Notwithstanding
the protest of the Basrians, he transported this booty
safely to Mecca. When his descendants had ascended the throne
and he had become a demi-saint, the historians did their best to
excuse his conduct. Hasan demanded, in exchange for the power
which he resigned, the contents of the treasury at Kufa, which
amounted to five millions of dirhems, together with the revenues
of the Persian province of Dar&#257;bjird (Darab). When these negotiations
became known, a mutiny broke out in Hasan&rsquo;s camp.
Hasan himself was wounded and retired to Medina, where he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>28</span>
died eight or nine years afterwards. The legend that he was
poisoned by order of Moawiya is without the least foundation.
It seems that he never received the revenues of Dar&#257;bjird, the
Basrians to whom they belonged refusing to cede them.</p>

<p>Moawiya now made his entry into Kufa in the summer of <span class="sc">a.h.</span>
41 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 661) and received the oath of allegiance as Prince of the
Believers. This year is called the year of union (<i>jam&#257;&lsquo;a</i>).
Mogh&#299;ra b. Sho&rsquo;ba was appointed governor of Kufa. Homr&#257;n b.
Ab&#257;n had previously assumed the government of Basra. This
is represented commonly as a revolt, but as Homran was a client
of Othman, and remained in favour with the Omayyads, it is
almost certain that he took the management of affairs only to
maintain order.</p>

<p>One strong antagonist to Moawiya remained, in the person of
Ziy&#257;d. This remarkable man was said to be a bastard of Abu
Sofi&#257;n, the father of Moawiya, and was, by his mother, the
brother of Abu Bakra, a man of great wealth and position at
Basra. He thus belonged to the tribe of Thaq&#299;f at T&#257;if, which
produced many very prominent men. At the age of fourteen
years Ziy&#257;d was charged with the financial administration of the
Basrian army. He had won the affection of Omar, by his knowledge
of the Koran and the Sunna of the Prophet, and by the fact
that he had employed the first money he earned to purchase the
freedom of his mother Somayya. He was a faithful servant of Ali
and put down for him the revolt excited by Moawiya&rsquo;s partisans
in Basra. Thence he marched into F&#257;rs and Kirman, where he
maintained peace and kept the inhabitants in their allegiance to
Ali. After Ali&rsquo;s death he fortified himself in his castle near
Istakhr and refused to submit. Moawiya, therefore, sent Bosr
b. Abi Art&#257;t to Basra, with orders to capture Ziy&#257;d&rsquo;s three sons,
and to force Ziy&#257;d into submission by threatening to kill them.
Ziy&#257;d was obdurate; and it was due to his brother Abu Bakra,
who persuaded Moawiya to cancel the order, that the threat was
not executed. On his return to Damascus, Moawiya charged
Mogh&#299;ra b. Sho&rsquo;ba to bring his countryman to reason. Abdallah
b. &lsquo;&#256;mir was made governor of Basra.</p>

<p>As soon as Moawiya had his hands free, he directed all his
forces against the Greeks. Immediately after the submission of
Irak, he had denounced the existing treaty, and as early as 662
had sent his troops against the Alans and the Greeks. Since then,
no year passed without a campaign. Twice he made a serious
effort to conquer Constantinople, in 669 when he besieged it for
three months, and in 674. On the second occasion his fleet
occupied Cyzicus, which it held till shortly after his death in 680,
when a treaty was signed. In Africa also the extension of
Mahommedan power was pursued energetically. In 670 took
place the famous march of &lsquo;Okba (&lsquo;Oqba) b. N&#257;fi&rsquo; and the foundation
of Kairawan, where the great mosque still bears his name.
Our information about these events, though very full, is untrustworthy,
while of the events in Asia Minor the accounts are scarce
and short. The Arabic historians are still absorbed by the events
in Irak and Khorasan.</p>

<p>The talented prefect of Kufa, Mogh&#299;ra b. Sho&rsquo;ba, eventually
broke down the resistance of Ziy&#257;d, who came to Damascus to
render an account of his administration, which the caliph
ratified. Moawiya seems also to have acknowledged him as the
son of Abu Sofi&#257;n, and thus as his brother; in 664 this recognition
was openly declared.<a name="fa13b" id="fa13b" href="#ft13b"><span class="sp">13</span></a> In the next year Ziy&#257;d was appointed
governor of Basra and the eastern provinces belonging to it. As
the austere champion of the precepts of Islam, he soon restored
order in the whole district. Outwardly, this was the case in
Kufa also. A rising of Kharijites in the year 663 had ended in
the death of their chief. But the Shi&lsquo;ites were dissatisfied and
even dared to give public utterance to their hostility. Mogh&#299;ra
contented himself with a warning. He was already aged and had
no mind to enter on a conflict. He died about the year 670, and
his province also was entrusted to Ziy&#257;d, who appointed &lsquo;Amr b.
Horaith as his vicegerent. At a Friday service in the great mosque
&lsquo;Amr was insulted and pelted with pebbles. Ziy&#257;d then came
himself, arrested the leader of the Shi&lsquo;ites, and sent fourteen rebels
to Damascus, among them several men of consideration. Seven of
them who refused to pledge themselves to obedience were put to
death; the Shi&lsquo;ites considered them as martyrs and accused
Moawiya of committing a great crime. But in Kufa peace was
restored, and this not by military force, but by the headmen of
the tribes. We must not forget that Kufa and Basra were
military colonies, and that each tribe had its own quarter of the
city. A wholesome diversion was provided by the serious resumption
of the policy of eastern expansion, which had been
interrupted by the civil war. For this purpose Irak had to
furnish the largest contingent. The first army sent by Ziy&#257;d
into Khorasan recaptured Merv, Herat and Balkh, conquered
Tokh&#257;rist&#257;n and advanced as far as the Oxus. In 673 &lsquo;Obaidallah,
the son of Ziy&#257;d, crossed the river, occupied Bokhara, and
returned laden with booty taken from the wandering Turkish
tribes of Transoxiana. He brought 2000 Turkish archers with
him to Basra, the first Turkish slaves to enter the Moslem empire.
Sa&lsquo;&#299;d, son of the caliph Othman, whom Moawiya made governor
of Khorasan, in 674 marched against Samarkand. Other
generals penetrated as far as the Indus and conquered Kabul,
Sijistan, Makr&#257;n and Kandahar.</p>

<p>Ziy&#257;d governed Irak with the greatest vigour, but as long as
discontent did not issue in action, he let men alone. At his death
(672-673), order was so generally restored that &ldquo;nobody had any
more to fear for life or estate, and even the unprotected woman
was safe in her house without having her door bolted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moawiya was a typical Arab <i>sayyid</i> (gentleman). He governed,
not by force, but by his superior intelligence, his self-control,
his mildness and magnanimity. The following anecdote may
illustrate this. One of Moawiya&rsquo;s estates bordered on that of
Abdallah b. Zobair, who complained in a somewhat truculent
letter that Moawiya&rsquo;s slaves had been guilty of trespassing.
Moawiya, disregarding his son Yazid&rsquo;s advice that he should
exact condign punishment for Zobair&rsquo;s disrespect, replied in
flattering terms, regretting the trespass and resigning both slaves
and estate to Zobair. In reply Zobair protested his loyalty to
Moawiya, who thereupon pointed a moral for the instruction of
Yazid.</p>

<p>Moawiya has been accused of having poisoned more than one of
his adversaries, among them Malik Ashtar, Abdarrahm&#257;n the
son of the great captain Kh&#257;lid b. Wal&#299;d, and Hasan b. Ali. As
for the latter, European scholars have long been agreed that the
imputation is groundless. As to Abdarrahm&#257;n the story is in the
highest degree improbable. Mad&#257;in&#299; says that Moawiya was
prompted to it, because when he consulted the Syrians about the
choice of his son Yazid as his successor, they had proposed
Abdarrahm&#257;n. The absurdity of this is obvious, for Abdarrahm&#257;n
died in the year 666.<a name="fa14b" id="fa14b" href="#ft14b"><span class="sp">14</span></a> Others say<a name="fa15b" id="fa15b" href="#ft15b"><span class="sp">15</span></a> that Moawiya was afraid
lest Abdarrahm&#257;n should become too popular. Now, Abdarrahm&#257;n
had not only been a faithful ally of Moawiya in the wars with
Ali, but after the peace devoted all his energy to the Greek war.
It is almost incredible that Moawiya out of petty jealousy would
have deprived himself of one of his best men. The probability is
that Abdarrahm&#257;n was ill when returning from the frontier, that
Moawiya sent him his own medical man, the Christian doctor Ibn
Oth&#257;l, and that the rumour arose that the doctor had poisoned
him. It is remarkable withal that this rumour circulated, not in
Homs (Emesa), where Abdarrahm&#257;n died, but in Medina. There
a young relation of Abdarrahm&#257;n was so roused by the taunt
that the death of his kinsman was unavenged, that he killed Ibn
Othal near the mosque of Damascus. Moawiya imprisoned him
and let him pay a high ransom, the law not permitting the talio
against a Moslem for having killed a Christian. The story that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>29</span>
this relative was Kh&#257;lid, the son of Abdarrahm&#257;n, is absurd
inasmuch as Moawiya made this Kh&#257;lid commander against the
Greeks in succession to his father. In the third case&mdash;that of
Malik Ashtar&mdash;the evidence is equally inadequate. In fact, since
Moawiya did not turn the weapon of assassination against such
men as Abdallah b. Zobair and Hosain b. Ali, it is unlikely that
he used it against less dangerous persons. These two men were
the chief obstacles to Moawiya&rsquo;s plan for securing the Caliphate
for his son Yazid. The leadership with the Arabic tribes was as a
rule hereditary, the son succeeding his father, but only if he was
personally fit for the position, and was acknowledged as such by
the principal men of the tribe. The hereditary principle had not
been recognized by Islam in the cases of Abu Bekr, Omar and
Othman; it had had some influence upon the choice of Ali, the
husband of Fatima and the cousin of the Prophet. But it had
been adopted entirely for the election of Hasan. The example of
Abu Bekr proved that the caliph had the right to appoint his
successor. But this appointment must be sanctioned by the
principal men, as representing the community. Moawiya seems
to have done his best to gain that approbation, but the details
given by the historians are altogether unconvincing. This only
seems to be certain, that the succession of Yazid was generally
acknowledged before the death of his father, except in Medina.
(See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan Institutions</a></span>.)</p>

<p>Moawiya died in the month of Rajab 60 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 680). His last
words are said to have been: &ldquo;Fear ye God, the Elevated and
Mighty, for God, Praise be to Him, protects the man that fears
Him; he who does not fear God, has no protection.&rdquo; Moawiya
was, in fact, a religious man and a strict disciple of the precepts
of Islam. We can scarcely, therefore, credit the charges made by
the adversaries of his chosen successor Yazid, that he was a
drinker of wine, fond of pleasure, careless about religion. All the
evidence shows that, during the reign of the Omayyads, life in
Damascus and the rest of Syria was austere and in striking
contrast to the dissolute manners which prevailed in Medina.</p>

<p>2. <i>Rule of Yazid.</i>&mdash;When Moawiya died, the opposition had
already been organized. On his accession Yazid sent a circular
to all his prefects, officially announcing his father&rsquo;s death, and
ordering them to administer the oath of allegiance to their
subjects. In that sent to Wal&#299;d b. &lsquo;Otba, the governor of
Medina, he enclosed a private note charging him in particular to
administer the oath to Hosain, Abdallah b. Omar and Abdallah
b. Zobair, if necessary, by force. Walid sent a messenger
inviting them to a conference, thus giving them time to assemble
their followers and to escape to Mecca, where the prefect Omar
b. Sa&lsquo;&#299;d could do nothing against them. In the month Ramadan
this Omar was made governor of Medina and sent an army against
Ibn Zobair. This army was defeated, and from that time Ibn
Zobair was supreme at Mecca.</p>

<p>On the news of Yazid&rsquo;s accession, the numerous partisans of
the family of Ali in Kufa sent addresses to Hosain, inviting him
to take refuge with them, and promising to have him proclaimed
caliph in Irak. Hosain, having learned that the majority of the
inhabitants were apparently ready to support him strenuously,
prepared to take action. Meanwhile Yazid, having been informed
of the riotous behaviour of the Shi&lsquo;ites in Kufa, sent
Obaidallah, son of the famous Ziy&#257;d and governor of Basra, to
restore order. Using the same tactics as his father had used
before, Obaidallah summoned the chiefs of the tribes and made
them responsible for the conduct of their men. On the 8th of
Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijja Hosain set out from Mecca with all his family,
expecting to be received with enthusiasm by the citizens of Kufa,
but on his arrival at Kerbela west of the Euphrates, he was
confronted by an army sent by Obaidallah under the command of
Omar, son of the famous Sa&lsquo;d b. Abi Waqq&#257;s, the founder of
Kufa. Hosain gave battle, vainly relying on the promised aid
from Kufa, and fell with almost all his followers on the 10th of
Muharram 61 (10th of October 680).</p>

<p>No other issue of this rash expedition could have been expected.
But, as it involved the grandson of the Prophet, the son of Ali,
and so many members of his family, Hosain&rsquo;s devout partisans
at Kufa, who by their overtures had been the principal cause of
the disaster, regarded it as a tragedy, and the facts gradually
acquired a wholly romantic colouring. Omar b. Sa&lsquo;d and his
officers, Obaidallah and even Yazid came to be regarded as
murderers, and their names have ever since been held accursed
by all Shi&lsquo;ites. They observe the 10th of Muharram, the day of
&lsquo;Ash&#363;ra, as a day of public mourning. Among the Persians, stages
are erected on that day in public places, and plays are acted,
representing the misfortunes of the family of Ali.<a name="fa16b" id="fa16b" href="#ft16b"><span class="sp">16</span></a> &ldquo;Revenge
for Hosain&rdquo; became the watchword of all Shi&lsquo;ites, and the
Meshed Hosain (Tomb of the martyr Hosain) at Kerbela is to
them the holiest place in the world (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Kerbela</a></span>). Obaidallah
sent the head of Hosain to Damascus, together with the women
and children and Ali b. Hosain, who, being ill, had not taken part
in the fight. Yazid was very sorry for the issue, and sent the
prisoners under safe-conduct to Medina. Ali remained faithful
to the caliph, taking no share in the revolt of the Medinians, and
openly condemning the risings of the Shi&lsquo;ites.</p>

<p>Ibn Zobair profited greatly by the distress caused by Hosain&rsquo;s
death. Though he named himself publicly a refugee of the House
of God, he had himself secretly addressed as caliph, and many of
the citizens of Medina acknowledged him as such. Yazid, when
informed of this, swore in his anger to have him imprisoned. But
remembering the wisdom of his father, he sent messengers with a
chain made of silver coins, and bearing honourable proposals.
At the same time he received a number of the chief men of
Medina, sent by the prefect, with great honour and loaded them
with gifts and presents. But Ibn Zobair refused, and the
Medinians, of whom the majority probably had never before
seen a prince&rsquo;s court, however simple, were only confirmed in
their rancour against Yazid, and told many horrible tales about
his profligacy, that he hunted and held wild orgies with Bedouin
sheikhs, and had no religion. A characteristically Arabic ceremony
took place in the mosque of Medina. &ldquo;I cast off the oath
of allegiance to Yazid, as I cast off my turban,&rdquo; exclaimed the
first, and all others followed, casting off one of their garments,
till a heap of turbans and sandals lay on the floor. Ibn &#7716;an&#7827;ala
was made commander. The Omayyads, though they with their
clients counted more than 1000 men, were not able to maintain
themselves, and were allowed to depart only on condition of strict
neutrality.</p>

<p>At last the patience of Yazid was exhausted. An army&mdash;the
accounts about the number vary from 4000 to 20,000&mdash;was
equipped in all haste and put under the command of Moslim b.
&lsquo;Oqba, with orders first to exact submission from the Medinians,
if necessary by force, and then to march against Ibn Zobair.
Moslim, having met the expelled Omayyads at W&#257;di &lsquo;l-Qor&#257;,
encamped near the city (August 683) and gave the inhabitants
three days in which to return to obedience, wishing to spare the
city of the Prophet and to prevent the shedding of blood. When,
however, after the lapse of three days, a final earnest appeal had
been answered insultingly, he began the battle. The Medinians
fought valiantly, but could not hold out against the well-disciplined
Syrians. Moreover, they were betrayed by the Medinian
family of the Ban&#363; &#7716;&#257;ritha, who introduced Syrian soldiers into
the town. Medina lies between two volcanic hills, called <i>harra</i>.
After one of these the battle has been named &ldquo;The Day of
Harra.&rdquo; For three days the city was given up to plunder. It is
said that a thousand bastards (the &ldquo;children of the Harra&rdquo;)
were born in consequence of these days. The remaining citizens
were compelled to take the oath of allegiance to Yazid in a
humiliating form; the few who refused were killed. Ali b.
Hosain, who had refused to have anything to do with the revolt,
was treated with all honour. Mahommed b. al-Hanafiya, the
son of Ali, and Abdallah b. Omar had likewise abstained, but
they had left Medina for Mecca.</p>

<p>Moslim then proceeded towards Mecca. He was already ill, and
died about midway between the two cities, after having given the
command, according to the orders of the caliph, to Hosain b.
Nomair. It is quite natural that the man who delivered up the
city of the Prophet to plunder, and at whose hands so many
prominent Moslems fell, should have been an object of detestation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
to the devout. Even some European scholars have drawn a
false picture of his personality, as has been clearly shown by
Wellhausen. About Medina also false statements have been
made. The city recovered very soon from the disaster, and
remained the seat not only of holy tradition and jurisdiction,
but also of the Arabic aristocracy. In no city of the empire,
during the reign of the Omayyads, lived more singers and
musicians than in Medina.</p>

<p>Hosain b. Nomair arrived before Mecca in September 683 and
found Ibn Zobair ready to defend it. A number of the citizens
of Medina had come to the aid of the Holy City, as well as many
Kharijites from Yam&#257;ma under Najda b. &lsquo;√Ñmir. The siege had
lasted 65&mdash;others say 40&mdash;days, when the news came of the
death of Yazid, which took place presumably on the 14th of
Rabia I, 64 (12th November 683). Eleven days before a fire,
caused by imprudence, had consumed all the woodwork of the
Ka&rsquo;ba and burst the black stone in three places. The evidence
is quite conclusive; yet the fire has been imputed to the Syrians,
and a tale was invented about ballistas which hurled against the
House of God enormous stones and vessels full of bitumen. In
fact, the siege had been confined to enclosure and skirmishes. It
is said that on the news of the death of Yazid a conference took
place between Hosain and Ibn Zobair, and that the former offered
to proclaim the latter as caliph provided he would accompany
him to Syria and proclaim a general amnesty. Ibn Zobair
refused haughtily, and Hosain, with a contemptuous criticism of
his folly, ordered his army to break up for Syria.</p>

<p>Hitherto Ibn Zobair had confined himself to an appeal to the
Moslems to renounce Yazid and to have a caliph elected by the
council (<i>sh&#363;r&#257;</i>) of the principal leading men. He now openly
assumed the title of caliph and invited men to take the oath of
allegiance. He was soon acknowledged throughout Arabia, in
Egypt and in Irak. The Omayyads, who had returned to Medina,
were again expelled.</p>

<p>Yazid is described in the <i>Continuatio Isidori Byz.</i> ¬ß27, as &ldquo;iucundissimus
et cunctis nationibus regni eius subditis vir gratissime
habitus, qui nullam unquam, ut omnibus moris est, sibi regalis
fastigii causa gloriam appetivit, sed communis<a name="fa17b" id="fa17b" href="#ft17b"><span class="sp">17</span></a> cum omnibus
civiliter vixit.&rdquo; This is confirmed by the fact that Moawiya II.
is said to have been a mild ruler, like his father, and goes far to
outweigh the prejudiced account given by his opponents and
coloured still further by tradition. Against the accusation of
being a drinker of wine he himself protested in verses which he
recited when he sent the army against Ibn Zobair. Decisive is
also the testimony of Ibn al-Hanafiya, who declared that all the
accusations brought by the Medinians were false. It may be
true that he was fond of hunting, but he was a peace-loving,
generous prince. It is uncertain at what age he died. Accounts
vary between 33 and 39. The latter finds confirmation in the
statement that he was born in <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 25, though another account
places his birth in 22. As his son Moawiya who succeeded him
was certainly adult (the accounts vary between 17 and 23), the
latter date seems to be preferable.</p>

<p>3. Moawiya II. had reigned a very short time&mdash;how long is
again wholly uncertain&mdash;when he fell sick and died. Then
commenced a period of the greatest confusion. The mother of
Yazid, Mais&#363;n, belonged to the most powerful tribe in Syria, the
Kalb, and it seems that this and the cognate tribes of Qod&#257;&lsquo;a
(Yemenites) had enjoyed certain prerogatives, which had aroused
the jealousy of the Qais and the cognate tribes of Modar. Immediately
after the death of Yazid, Zofar b. &#7716;&#257;rith, who had
already fought with Ibn Zobair against Yazid, had induced
northern Syria and Mesopotamia to declare for Ibn Zobair. In
Homs (Emesa) the governor No&lsquo;m&#257;n b. Bash&#299;r had pledged
himself to the same cause. The prefect of Damascus, &#7692;a&#7717;&#7717;&#257;k b.
Qais, seemed to be wavering in his loyalty. Kh&#257;lid, the brother
of Moawiya II., was still a youth and appears to have had no
strength of character. There was, however, a much more
dangerous candidate, viz. Merw&#257;n b. &#7716;akam, of another branch
of the Omayyads, who had been Othman&rsquo;s right-hand man. He
had pledged himself after some hesitation to Yazid, but now his
turn had come. The amir of the Kalb, Ibn Ba&#7717;dal, persuaded
probably by Obaidallah b. Ziy&#257;d, conceived that only a man of
distinction could win the contest, and proclaimed Merwan
caliph, on condition that his successor should be Kh&#257;lid b.
Yazid, and after him &lsquo;Amr b. Sa&lsquo;&#299;d al-Ashdaq, who belonged to
the third branch of the Omayyads. Meanwhile &#7692;a&#7717;&#7717;&#257;k had
declared himself openly for Ibn Zobair. A furious battle (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>
684) ensued at Merj R&#257;hi&#7789;, near Damascus, in which &#7692;a&#7717;&#7717;&#257;k
and Zofar, though they had the majority of troops, were utterly
defeated. This battle became the subject of a great many
poems and had pernicious consequences, especially as regards
the antagonism between the Qais-Mo&#7693;ar and Kalb-Yemenite
tribes.</p>

<p>4. <i>Reign of Merwan I.</i>&mdash;Merwan strengthened his position
according to the old oriental fashion by marrying the widow of
Yazid, and soon felt himself strong enough to substitute his own
son Abdalmalik for Kh&#257;lid b. Yazid as successor-designate.
Kh&#257;lid contented himself with protesting; he was neither a
politician nor a soldier, but a student of alchemy and astronomy;
translations of Greek books have been ascribed to him (J&#257;&#7717;iz,
<i>Bay&#257;n</i>, i. p. 126). In the year <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 435 there was still in Egypt
a brazen globe attributed to Ptolemy which had belonged to
Kh&#257;lid (Ibn Qift&#299;, p. 440, 1.15). He was also consulted about
future events. There were, however, not a few who deplored
the fact that the throne had passed from the descendants of
Abu Sofi&#257;n. This feeling gave rise to the prophecy that there
should appear later a Sofian&#299; on the throne, who would reign
with might and wisdom. &lsquo;Amr Ashdaq made no opposition till
the death of Merwan. After the victory at Merj R&#257;hi&#7789;, Merwan
conquered Egypt, and installed as governor his second son
Abdalaz&#299;z. An army sent to the rescue by Ibn Zobair under the
command of his brother Mu&#7779;&lsquo;ab was beaten in Palestine by
&lsquo;Amr Ashdaq. But a division sent by Merwan to the Hejaz was
cut to pieces. Obaidallah b. Ziy&#257;d set out with the purpose of
subduing Mesopotamia and marching thence against Irak. But
he was detained a whole year in the former country, by a rising
of the Shi&lsquo;ites in Kufa, who were still in mourning for Hosain
and had formed an army which called itself &ldquo;the army of the
penitent.&rdquo; They were routed at Ras &lsquo;Ain, but Obaidallah had
still to fight Zofar.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mokht&#257;r (son of that Abu &lsquo;Obaid the Thaqifite who
had commanded the Arabs against the Persians in the unfortunate
battle of the Bridge), a man of great talents and still
greater ambition, after having supported Ibn Zobair in the siege
of Mecca, had gone to Kufa, where he joined the Shi&lsquo;ites, mostly
Persians, and acquired great power. He claimed that he was
commissioned by Ali&rsquo;s son, Mahommed ibn al-Hanafiya, who
after the death of Hosain was recognized by the Shi&lsquo;ites as their
Mahdi. A vague message from Mahommed, that it was the duty
of every good Moslem to take part with the family of the Prophet,
was interpreted in favour of Mokht&#257;r, and thenceforward all the
Shi&lsquo;ites, among them the powerful Ibr&#257;h&#299;m, son of Ali&rsquo;s right
hand Malik Ashtar, followed him blindly as their chief. Afterwards
Ibn al-Hanafiya seems to have acknowledged him distinctly
as his vicegerent. Ibn Zobair&rsquo;s representative in Kufa
was compelled to flee, and all those who had participated in the
battle of Kerbela were put to death. An army despatched
against Obaidallah under Ibr&#257;h&#299;m routed the Syrians near
Mosul (battle of Kh&#257;zir); Obaidallah and Hosain b. Nomair
were slain. Mokht&#257;r was now at the zenith of power, but Ibn
Zobair, determined to get rid at all costs of so dangerous an
enemy, named his brother Mu&#7779;&lsquo;ab governor of Basra and ordered
him to march against Kufa. Basra was at that time full of
fugitives from Kufa, Arabian chiefs who resented the arrogance of
Mokht&#257;r&rsquo;s adherents, and desired eagerly to regain their former
position in Kufa. The troops of Basra had been, since the death
of Yazid, at war with the Kharijites, who had supported Ibn
Zobair during the siege of Mecca, but had deserted him later.
Their caliph, N&#257;fi&rsquo; b. Azraq, after whom they were called also
Azraqites, threatened even the city itself, when Mohallab b. Abi
&#7778;ofra, a very able general, compelled them to retire. Mohallab
then marched with Mu&#7779;&lsquo;ab against Kufa. Mokht&#257;r fell, and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>31</span>
him the ephemeral dominion of the Persian Shi&lsquo;ites. This had
been their first attempt to dispute the authority of their Arabian
conquerors, but it was not to be the last. Ibr&#257;h&#299;m b. Ashtar,
Mokhtar&rsquo;s governor of Mesopotamia, submitted and acknowledged
the Caliphate of Ibn Zobair.</p>

<p>5. Reign of Abdalmalik.&mdash;Merwan died on the 27th of Ramadan
65 (7th May 685); according to tradition, he was suffocated by
his wife, because he had insulted her son Kh&#257;lid and herself.
The accession of Abdalmalik was attended with no difficulty,
but the first years of his reign were occupied by troubles in
northern Syria, where, instigated by the Greeks, the Mardaites
of the Amanus, called Jar&#257;jima by the Arabs, penetrated into
the Lebanon. He was obliged to conclude an unfavourable
treaty first with them, later with the emperor of Constantinople.
Moreover, in the year 68 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 687-688) Syria was afflicted by a
serious famine. Ibn Zobair, however, was occupied at Mecca
with the rebuilding of the Ka&rsquo;ba, and Mu&#7779;&lsquo;ab was harassed not
only by the Kharijites, but also by a noble freebooter, Obaidallah
b. &#7716;orr, who had created for himself a principality in the vicinity
of Mad&#257;in (Ctesiphon).</p>

<p>The period of the pilgrimage caused a momentary truce to all
these struggles, and in Dhu &lsquo;l-hijja, <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 68 (January 688), was
seen the curious spectacle of four different standards planted
near Mecca, belonging respectively to four chiefs, each of whom
was a pretender to the empire; the standard of Abdallah b.
Zobair, caliph of Mecca; that of the caliph of Damascus,
Abdalmalik; that of Ali&rsquo;s son Mahommed b. al-Hanafiya, Mahdi
of the Shi&lsquo;ites; and that of the Kharijites, who were at that time
under the command of Najda b. &lsquo;&#256;mir. Such, however, was the
respect inspired by the holy places, that no disorders resulted.</p>

<p>When, in the year (69 <span class="sc">a.h.</span>) 689 Abdalmalik had at last encamped
at Bo&#7789;&#257;n &#7716;ab&#299;b in the vicinity of Kinnesrin (Qinnasr&#299;n),<a name="fa18b" id="fa18b" href="#ft18b"><span class="sp">18</span></a>
with the purpose of marching against Mu&#7779;&lsquo;ab, his cousin &lsquo;Amr
Ashdaq, to whom by the treaty of J&#257;bia, before the battle of
Merj R&#257;hit, the succession to Merwan had been promised, took
advantage of his absence to lay claim to the supreme power, and
to have himself proclaimed caliph by his partisans. Abdalmalik
was obliged to retrace his steps and to lay siege to his own capital.
The garrison of Damascus took fright, and deserted their posts,
so that &lsquo;Amr Ashdaq was compelled to surrender. The caliph
Abdalmalik summoned him to his palace and slew him with his
own hand. Abdalmalik has every claim to our esteem as one of
the ablest monarchs that ever reigned, but this murder remains
a lasting blot on his career.</p>

<p>Abdalmalik could now give his whole attention to the projected
expedition against Irak. Mu&#7779;&lsquo;ab was encamped at
B&#257;jomair&#257; in the neighbourhood of Takr&#299;t. But Abdalmalik&rsquo;s
first task was to subdue Zofar and his Qaisites at Kerkesia
(Qarq&#299;sia), and the rest of the partisans of Mokht&#257;r at Nisibis.
Meanwhile, Mu&#7779;&lsquo;ab had to curb a violent revolt in Basra, brought
about by agents of Abdalmalik, and called after a place in the
city the revolt of the Jofrites. About the middle of <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 691
Abdalmalik at last encamped at Dair al-Jathal&#299;q (the monastery
of the Catholicus) between Maskin, not far from the site of
Bagdad, and B&#257;jomair&#257;. Mu&#7779;&lsquo;ab&rsquo;s best troops were fighting
under Mohallab against the Kharijites; many Basrians were
secretly favourable to the Omayyads, nor were the Kufian
soldiers to be trusted. The people of Irak had never been
accustomed to discipline, and no improvement had taken place
during the troubles of the last years. Abdalmalik, therefore,
wrote secretly to the chiefs of Mu&#7779;&lsquo;ab&rsquo;s army, and persuaded them
to desert to him, with the exception of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m b. Ashtar, the
brave son of a brave father, who, after the fall of Mokht&#257;r, had
become a faithful supporter of Ibn Zobair. His death, in the
beginning of the battle, decided the fate of Mu&#7779;&lsquo;ab, who was
slain sword in hand by a Shi&lsquo;ite of Kufa.</p>

<p>This victory opened the gates of Kufa to Abdalmalik, and all
Irak received him with acclamation. Thence, a few days later,
he sent Hajj&#257;j b. Yusuf at the head of 2000 Syrians against Ibn
Zobair in Mecca, and despatched a messenger to T&#257;riq b.&lsquo;Amr, who
was encamped at W&#257;di &lsquo;l-Qor&#257; with 5000 men, to make himself
master of Medina and thence to rejoin Hajj&#257;j. Before the
arrival of this reinforcement, Hajj&#257;j confined himself to skirmishes,
in which his soldiers always had the advantage. Then,
in Dhu &lsquo;l Qa&lsquo;da 72 (March 25th, 692) Mecca was invested. The
blockade lasted more than six months, during which the city was
a prey to all the horrors of siege and famine. Hajj&#257;j had set up a
balista on the hill of Abu Qobais, whence he poured on the city a
hail of stones, which was suspended only in the days of the
pilgrimage. Ibn Zobair employed against him Abyssinians
armed with Greek-fire-tubes, who, however, quitted him soon
under the pressure of famine. This at length triumphed over his
last adherents. Ten thousand fighting men, and even two of the
sons of the pretender (it is said, on his own advice), left the city
and surrendered. Mecca being thus left without defenders, Ibn
Zobair saw that ruin was inevitable. Hajj&#257;j having promised
him amnesty if he would surrender, he went to his mother Asm&#257;,
the daughter of Abu Bekr, who had reached the age of a hundred
years, and asked her counsel. She answered that, if he was
confident in the justice of his cause, he must die sword in hand.
In embracing him for the last time, she felt the cuirass he wore
and exclaimed that such a precaution was unworthy of a man
resolved to die. He, therefore, took off the cuirass, and, when
the Omayyad troops made their way into the city, attacked them
furiously, notwithstanding his advanced age, and was slain. His
head was cut off, and sent by Hajj&#257;j to Damascus.</p>

<p>With Ibn Zobair perished the influence which the early
companions of Mahomet had exercised over Islam. Medina and
Mecca, though they continued to be the holy cities, had no longer
their old political importance, which had already been shaken to
its foundations by the murder of Othman and the subsequent
troubles. Henceforward we shall find temporal interests,
represented by Damascus, predominating over those of religion,
and the centre of Islam, now permanently removed beyond the
limits of Arabia, more susceptible to foreign influence, and
assimilating more readily their civilizing elements. Damascus,
Kufa and Basra will attract the flower of all the Moslem provinces,
and thus that great intellectual, literary and scientific
movement, which reached its apogee under the first Abbasid
Caliphs at Bagdad, steadily becomes more marked.</p>

<p>After the burning of the Ka&rsquo;ba during the siege of Mecca by
Hosain b. Nomair, Ibn Zobair had rebuilt and enlarged the house
of God. It is said that he thus carried out a design of the
Prophet, which he had not ventured to undertake for fear of
offending the newly converted Koreishites. Hajj&#257;j pulled down
the enlargements and restored the Ka&lsquo;ba to its old state. Meanwhile,
the caliph committed to him the government of the Hejaz.
The Medinians, whose loyalty was suspected, were treated by
him with severity; not a few <i>maulas</i> (clients) were obliged to
wear a leaden badge on their neck (Tabar&#299;, ii. p. 854 seq.).</p>

<p>Thus the protracted war against Ibn Zobair was brought to an
end; hence this year (71) also is called the &ldquo;year of union&rdquo;
(<i>jam&#257;&lsquo;a</i>). But the storms in Irak and Mesopotamia had not yet
altogether subsided. The Qais could not leave unavenged the
blood shed at Merj R&#257;hit. For about ten years the Syrian and
Mesopotamian deserts were the scene of a series of raids, often
marked by great cruelty, and which have been the subject of a
great many poems. Abdalmalik had need of all his tact and
energy to pacify ultimately the zealous sectaries, but the
antagonism between Yemenites (Kalb and Azd) and Mo&#7693;arites
(Qais and Tam&#299;m) had been increased by these struggles, and
even in the far east and the far west had fatal consequences.</p>

<p>When Abdalmalik, after a stay of forty days, returned from Irak
to Syria, he left two Omayyad princes as his vicegerents in Kufa
and Basra. Mohallab, who at the time of the battle of B&#257;jomair&#257;
was in the field against the Azraq&#299;tes (Kharijites), and had put
himself at the disposal of the caliph, had orders to carry on the
war. But the two princes proved unequal to their task and did
not support Mohallab sufficiently, so that the Kharijites gained
more than one victory. Abdalmalik in alarm made Hajj&#257;j
governor of Irak with the most extensive powers. The troops of
Kufa, who accompanied Mohallab in an expedition against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span>
Kharijites, had abandoned their general and dispersed to their
homes, and nothing could induce them to return to their duty.
Then, in the year 75 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 694), at the moment when the people
were assembled in the mosque for morning prayers, an unknown
young man of insignificant appearance, with a veil over his face,
ascended the pulpit. It seemed at first that he could not find his
words. One of the audience, with a contemptuous remark, took
a handful of pebbles to pelt him with. But he let them fall when
Hajj&#257;j lifted his veil and began to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men of Kufa,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I see before me heads ripe for the
sickle, and the reaper&mdash;I am he. It seems to me, as if I saw
already the blood between your turbans and your shoulders. I
am not one of those who can be frightened by inflated bags of skin,
nor need any one think to squeeze me like a fig. The Prince of
the Believers has spread before him the arrows of his quiver, and
has tried every one of them by biting its wood. It is my wood
that he has found the hardest and strongest, and I am the arrow
which he shoots against you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end of this address he ordered his clerk to read the
letter of the caliph. He began: &ldquo;From the servant of God,
Abdalmalik, Prince of the Believers, to the Moslems that are in
Kufa, peace be with you.&rdquo; As nobody uttered a word in reply,
Hajj&#257;j said: &ldquo;Stop, boy,&rdquo; and exclaimed: &ldquo;The Prince of the
Believers salutes you, and you do not answer his greeting! You
have been but poorly taught. I will teach you afresh, unless
you behave better. Read again the letter of the Prince of the
Believers.&rdquo; Then, as soon as he had read: &ldquo;peace upon ye,&rdquo;
there remained not a single man in the mosque who did not
respond, &ldquo;and upon the Prince of the Believers be peace.&rdquo;
Thereupon Hajj&#257;j ordered that every man capable of bearing
arms should immediately join Mohallab in Kh&#363;zist&#257;n (Susiana),
and swore that all who should be found in the town after the third
day should be beheaded. This threat had its effect, and Hajj&#257;j
proceeded to Ba&#7779;ra, where his presence was followed by the same
results. Mohallab, reinforced by the army of Irak, at last
succeeded, after a struggle of eighteen months, in subjugating
the Kharijites and their caliph Qatara b. Foj&#257;&lsquo;a, and was able at
the beginning of the year 78 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 697) to return to Hajj&#257;j at
Ba&#7779;ra. The latter loaded him with honours and made him
governor of Khorasan, whence he directed several expeditions
into Transoxiana. In the meantime Hajj&#257;j himself had, in 695
and 696, with great difficulty suppressed Shab&#299;b b. Yaz&#299;d at the
head of the powerful tribe of Shaib&#257;n, who, himself a Kharijite,
had assumed the title of Prince of the Believers, and had even
succeeded in occupying Kufa. In the east the realm of Islam
had been very much extended under the reign of Moawiya,
when Ziy&#257;d was governor of Irak and Khorasan. Balkh and
Tokh&#257;rist&#257;n, Bokhara, Samarkand and Khwarizm (modern
Khiva), even Kabul and Kandahar had been subdued; but in
the time of the civil war a great deal had been lost again. Now
at last the task of recovering the lost districts could be resumed.
When, in 697, Hajj&#257;j gave the government of Khorasan to
Mohallab, he committed that of Sijist&#257;n (Seistan) to Obaidallah
b. Abi Bakra, a cousin of Ziy&#257;d. This prefect allowed himself to
be enticed by Zanb&#299;l, prince of Zabulistan, to penetrate into the
country far from his base, and escaped narrowly, not without
severe losses. The command over Sijist&#257;n was now given to
Abdarrahman b. Ash&lsquo;ath, a descendant of the old royal family of
Kinda, and a numerous army was entrusted to him, so magnificently
equipped that it was called &ldquo;the peacock army.&rdquo; Not
long after his arrival in Sijist&#257;n, Ibn Ash&lsquo;ath, exasperated by the
masterful tone of Hajj&#257;j, the plebeian, towards himself, the
high-born, decided to revolt. The soldiers of Irak, who did not
love the governor, and disliked the prospect of a long and
difficult war far from home, eagerly accepted the proposition of
returning to Irak, and even proclaimed the dethronement of
Abdalmalik, in favour of Ibn Ash&lsquo;ath. The new pretender
entered F&#257;rs and Ahw&#257;z (Susiana), and it was in this last province
near Tostar (Shuster) that Hajj&#257;j came up with him, after
receiving from Syria the reinforcements which he had demanded
in all haste from the caliph. Ibn Ash&lsquo;ath drove him back to
Ba&#7779;ra, entered the city, and then turned his arms against Kufa,
of which he took possession with aid from within. Hajj&#257;j,
afraid lest his communications with Syria should be cut off,
pitched his camp at Dair Qorra, eighteen miles west from Kufa
towards the desert, where Mahommed, the brother of the caliph,
and Abdallah, his son, brought him fresh troops. Ibn Ash&lsquo;ath
encamped not far from him at Dair al-Jam&#257;jim with a far more
numerous army. In great alarm Abdalmalik endeavoured to
stifle the revolt by offering to dismiss Hajj&#257;j from his post.
The insurgents rejected this offer, and hostilities recommenced.
At the end of three months and a half, in July 702, a decisive
action took place. Victory declared for Hajj&#257;j. Ibn Ash&lsquo;ath
fled to Ba&#7779;ra, where he managed to collect fresh troops; but
having been again beaten in a furious battle that took place at
Maskin near the Dojail, he took refuge at Ahw&#257;z, from which he
was soon driven by the troops of Hajj&#257;j under &lsquo;Om&#257;ra b. Tam&#299;m.
The rebel then retired to Sijist&#257;n, and afterwards sought an
asylum with the king of Kabul. His partisans fled before
&lsquo;Om&#257;ra&rsquo;s army and penetrated into Khorasan, where they were
isarmed by the governor Yaz&#299;d, son of the celebrated Mohallab,
who had died in the year 701. The pretender was betrayed by
the king of Kabul and killed himself. His head was sent to
Hajj&#257;j and then to Damascus. This happened in the year 703
or 704. Yazid b. Mohallab was soon after deprived of the
government of Khorasan, <span class="correction" title="amended from Majjaj">Hajj&#257;j</span> accusing him of partiality
towards the rebels of Yemenite extraction. He appointed in his
stead first his brother Mofa&#7693;&#7693;al b. Mohallab, and nine months
after Qotaiba b. Moslim, who was destined in a later period to
extend the sway of Islam in the east as far as China.</p>

<p>The struggle of Ibn Ash&lsquo;ath was primarily a contest for
hegemony between Irak and Syria. The proud Arabic lords
could not acquiesce in paying to a plebeian like Hajj&#257;j, invested
with absolute power by the caliph, the strict obedience he required.
They considered it further as an injustice that the
Syrian soldiers received higher pay than those of Irak. This is
apparent from the fact that one of the conditions of peace
proposed by Abdalmalik before the battle of Dair al-Jam&#257;jim
had been that henceforth the Irakian troops should be paid
equally with the Syrian. Moreover, Hajj&#257;j, in order to <span class="correction" title="amended from maintian">maintain</span>
the regular revenue from taxation, had been obliged to introduce
stringent regulations, and had compelled a great many villagers
who had migrated to the cities to return to their villages.
Several of these were <i>faq&#299;hs</i>, students of Koranic science and law,
and all these seconded Ibn Ash&lsquo;ath with all their might. But, as
Wellhausen has shown, it is not correct to consider the contest as
a reaction of the <i>maula&rsquo;s</i> (Persian Moslems) against the Arabic
supremacy.</p>

<p>Immediately after the victories of Dair al-Jam&#257;jim and
Maskin, in 702, Hajj&#257;j, built a new residence on the Tigris,
between Ba&#7779;ra and Kufa, which he called W&#257;sit (&ldquo;Middle&rdquo;).
There his Syrian soldiers were not in contact with the turbulent
citizens of the two capitals, and were at any moment ready to
suppress any fresh outburst.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his reign Abdalmalik had replaced the
humble mosque built by Omar on the site of the temple at
Jerusalem by a magnificent dome, which was completed in the
year 691. Eutychius and others pretend that he desired to
substitute Jerusalem for Mecca, because Ibn Zobair had occupied
the latter place, and thus the pilgrimage to the Ka&lsquo;ba had become
difficult for the Syrians. This is quite improbable. Abdalmalik
was born and educated in Islam, and distinguished himself in his
youth by piety and continence. He regarded himself as the
champion of Islam and of the communion of the believers, and
had among his intimates men of acknowledged devoutness such
as Raj&#257; b. &#7716;aywa. The idea of interfering with the pilgrimage
to the House of God at Mecca, which would have alienated from
him all religious men, and thus from a political point of view
would have been suicidal, cannot have entered his mind for a
moment. But the glorification of Jerusalem, holy alike for
Moslems, Christians and Jews, could not but exalt the glory of
Islam and its rulers within and without.</p>

<p>As soon as the expedition to Irak against Mu&#7779;&lsquo;ab had terminated,
the holy war against the Greeks was renewed. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>
operations in Asia Minor and Armenia were entrusted to
Mahommed b. Merwan, the caliph&rsquo;s brother, who was appointed
governor of Mesopotamia and Armenia, and in 692 beat the
army of Justinian II. near Sebaste in Cilicia. From this time
forth the Moslems made yearly raids, the chief advantage of
which was that they kept the Syrian and Mesopotamian Arabs
in continual military exercise. After the victorious march of
Okba (Oqba) b. N&#257;fi&rsquo; through north Africa and the foundation of
Kairawan, his successor Qais b. Zohair had been obliged to
retreat to Barca (Cyrenaica). In the year 696 Abdalmalik sent
Hass&#257;n b. No&lsquo;m&#257;n into Africa at the head of a numerous army.
He retook Kairawan, swept the coast as far as Carthage, which he
sacked, expelling the Greek garrisons from all the fortified places;
he then turned his arms against the Berbers, who, commanded by
the K&#257;hina (Diviner), as the Arabs called their queen, beat him
so completely that he was compelled to retreat to Barca. Five
years later he renewed the war, defeated and killed the K&#257;hina,
and subdued the Berbers, who henceforward remained faithful to
the Arabs. Hass&#257;n continued to be governor of Kairawan till
after the death of Abdalmalik.</p>

<p>In the meantime Abdalmalik reconstituted the administration
of the empire on Arabic principles. Up to the year 693 the
Moslems had no special coinage of their own, and chiefly used
Byzantine and Persian money, either imported or struck by
themselves. Moawiya, indeed, had struck dinars and dirhems
with a Moslem inscription, but his subjects would not accept
them as there was no cross upon them. Abdalmalik instituted
a purely Islamitic coinage. If we may believe Theophanes, who
says that Justinian II. refused to receive these coins in payment
of the tribute and therefore declared the treaty at an end, we
must put the beginning of the coinage at least two years earlier.
Hajj&#257;j coined silver dirhems at Kufa in 694. A still greater
innovation was that Arabic became the official language of the
state. In the conquered countries till then, not only had the
Greek and Persian administration been preserved, but Greek
remained the official language in the western, Persian in the
eastern provinces. All officials were now compelled to know
Arabic and to conduct their administration in that language.
To this change was due in great measure the predominance of
Arabic throughout the empire. Lastly, a regular post service
was instituted from Damascus to the provincial capitals, especially
destined for governmental despatches. The postmasters
were charged with the task of informing the caliph of all important
news in their respective countries.</p>

<p>All the great rivals of Abdalmalik having now disappeared,
he was no longer like his predecessors <i>primus inter pares</i>, but
<i>dominus</i>. Under his rule the members of the Omayyad house
enjoyed a greater amount of administrative control than had
formerly been the case, but high office was given only to competent
men. He succeeded in reconciling the sons of &lsquo;Amr
Ashdaq, and also Kh&#257;lid b. Yazid, to whom he gave his own
daughter in marriage. He himself had married &lsquo;&#256;tika, a daughter
of Yazid, a union which was in all respects a happy one. He
took great care in the education of his sons, whom he destined
as his successors. His brother Abdalaz&#299;z, governor of Egypt,
whom Merwan had marked out as his successor, died in the year
703 or 704, and Abdalmalik chose as heirs to the empire first
his son Wal&#299;d, and after him his second son Suleim&#257;n. He
himself died on the 14th Shaww&#257;l 86 (9th October 705) at the age
of about sixty. His reign was one of the most stormy in the
annals of Islam, but also one of the most glorious. Abdalmalik
not only brought triumph to the cause of the Omayyads, but
also extended and strengthened the Moslem power as a whole.
He was well versed in old Arabic tradition and in the doctrine
of Islam, and was passionately fond of poetry. His court was
crowded with poets, whom he loaded with favours, even if they
were Christians like Akhtal. In his reign flourished also the two
celebrated rivals of Akhtal, Jar&#299;r and Farazdaq.</p>

<p>6. <i>Reign of Walid I.</i>&mdash;This is the most glorious epoch in the
history of Islam. In Asia Minor and Armenia, Maslama, brother
of the caliph, and his generals obtained numerous successes
against the Greeks. Tyana was conquered after a long siege,
and a great expedition against Constantinople was in preparation.
In Armenia Maslama advanced even as far as the Caucasus. In
Africa, M&#363;s&#257; b. No&#7779;air, who succeeded Hass&#257;n b. No&lsquo;m&#257;n as
governor, in a short time carried his conquests as far as Fez,
Tangier and Ceuta, and one of his captains even made a descent
on Sicily and plundered Syracuse. When he returned from the
west to Kairawan, he made his client &#7788;&#257;riq (or Tarik) governor
of Tangier and of the whole western part of Africa. Under him
the chiefs who had submitted to the Moslem arms retained
their authority. One of them was the Greek exarch of Tangier,
Julian, who, supported by the powerful Berber tribe of Ghom&#275;ra,
had long resisted and even asked for aid from Spain, but had
been compelled to surrender and was left governor of Ceuta.
Meanwhile in Spain, after the death of the Gothic king Witiza
in the year 90 (708-709), anarchy arose, which was terminated
by the council of noblemen at Toledo electing Roderic, the powerful
duke of Baetica, to be his successor in the fifth year of Walid.
The eldest son of Witiza then applied to Julian, and asked the aid
of the Arabs for the recovery of his father&rsquo;s throne. &#7788;&#257;riq
forwarded the embassy to Kairawan, and M&#363;s&#257; asked the
caliph&rsquo;s permission to send an expedition into Spain. Authorized
by M&#363;s&#257;, &#7788;&#257;riq now sent, in Ramadan 91 (July 710), 500 Berbers
under the command of &#7788;&#257;rif to reconnoitre the country. This
expedition, seconded by partisans of Witiza, was successful. In
the beginning of <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 711 Roderic had been summoned to the
north on account of an invasion of Navarra by the Franks,
caused, it is said, by the conspirators. &#7788;&#257;riq, thus certain of
meeting no serious opposition to his landing, passed into Spain
himself with an army composed mainly of Berbers of the Ghom&#275;ra
tribe under the guidance of Julian. The spot where he landed
thence acquired the name of Jebel &#7788;&#257;riq, &ldquo;Mountain of &#7788;&#257;riq,&rdquo;
afterwards corrupted into Gibraltar. Having made himself
master of Alge√ßiras and thereby secured his communication with
Africa, &#7788;&#257;riq set out at once in the direction of Cordova. At the
news of the invasion Roderic hastened back and led a numerous
army against the combined forces of &#7788;&#257;riq and the partisans of
Witiza. A fierce battle took place in the plain of Barbata on the
little river of Guadaleta (north of Medina Sidonia), in which
Roderic was completely routed. The spoils of the victors were
immense, especially in horses, but the king himself had disappeared.
Fearing lest he should have escaped to Toledo and
should there fit out another army, the partisans of Witiza
insisted that &#7788;&#257;riq should march immediately against the capital.
&#7788;&#257;riq complied with their wishes, notwithstanding the express
command of M&#363;s&#257; b. Nosair that he should not venture too far
into the country, and the protests of Julian. Having made
himself master of Ecija and having despatched a detachment
under Mogh&#299;th against Cordova, &#7788;&#257;riq took Mentesa (Villanueva
de la Fuente) and marched upon Toledo, which he soon conquered.
At the same time Mogh&#299;th took Cordova. But,
notwithstanding these successes, &#7788;&#257;riq knew that his situation
was most critical. King Roderic, who had escaped to Lusitania,
and the noble Goths, who had fled from Toledo, would certainly
not be slow in making efforts to regain what they had lost. He
therefore sent a message in all haste to M&#363;s&#257;, entreating him to
come speedily. M&#363;s&#257;, though angered by the disobedience of
&#7788;&#257;riq, hastened to the rescue and embarked in April 712 with
18,000 men, among them many noble Arabs, and began, advised
by Julian, a methodical campaign, with the purpose of establishing
and securing a line of communication between the sea
and Toledo. After having taken Seville, Carmona and Merida,
he marched from the latter place by the Via Romana to Salamanca,
after having ordered &#7788;&#257;riq to rejoin him in order to
encounter king Roderic. Not far from Tamames the king was
defeated and killed. King Alphonso the Great found his tombstone
at Viseo with the inscription, &ldquo;Hic requiescit Rodericus rex
Gothorum.&rdquo; After this battle M&#363;s&#257; reconquered Toledo, which,
after the departure of &#7788;&#257;riq, had recovered its independence,
and entered the capital in triumph. Already, before the expedition
to Salamanca, he had perceived that the sons of Witiza had
neither military nor political ability. He therefore proclaimed
the caliph of Damascus as sole ruler of the whole peninsula.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>34</span>
The Gothic princes must content themselves with honours and
apanages, in which they readily acquiesced. In the same year
93 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 712) M&#363;s&#257; struck Moslem coins with Latin inscriptions.
M&#363;s&#257; then continued the subjugation of Spain, till Walid recalled
him to Damascus. He obeyed after having appointed his son
Abdalaz&#299;z governor of Andalos (Andalusia), as the Arabs named
the peninsula, and assigned Seville as his residence. Abdalaz&#299;z
consolidated his power by marrying the widow of the late king
Roderic. M&#363;s&#257; left Spain about August 714, and reached
Damascus shortly before the death of Walid. Notwithstanding
the immense booty he brought, he did not receive his due reward.
Accused of peculation, he was threatened with imprisonment
unless he paid a fine of 100,000 pieces of gold. The old man&mdash;he
was born in the year 640&mdash;was released by Yazid b. Mohallab,
the then mighty favourite of the caliph Suleiman, but died in
the same year 716 on his way to Mecca. His son Abdalaz&#299;z was
an excellent ruler, who did much for the consolidation of the
new conquests, but he reigned only one year and eleven months,
when he was murdered. His death has been falsely imputed by
some historians to the caliph Suleiman.<a name="fa19b" id="fa19b" href="#ft19b"><span class="sp">19</span></a></p>

<p>In the East the Moslem armies gained the most astonishing
successes. In the course of a few years Qotaiba b. Moslim
conquered Paikend, Bokhara, Samarkand, Khwarizm (mod.
Khiva), Ferghana and Sh&#257;sh (Tashkent), and even Kashgar on
the frontiers of China. Meanwhile Mahommed b. Q&#257;sim invaded
Makran, took Daibol, passed the Indus, and marched, after
having beaten the Indian king Daher, through Sind upon Mult&#257;n,
which he conquered and whence he carried off an immense booty.</p>

<p>Walid was the first caliph, born and trained as prince, who
felt the majesty of the imamate and wished it to be felt by his
subjects. He desired to augment the splendours of Islam and
its sovereign, as Abdalmalik had already done by building the
dome of Jerusalem. In the time of the conquest of Damascus,
one half of the great church had been made a mosque, while the
remaining half had been left to the Christians. Walid annexed
this part, indemnifying the Christians elsewhere, and restored
the whole building sumptuously and magnificently. In his time
many fine palaces and beautiful villas were built in Syria, and
Becker&rsquo;s conjecture seems not altogether improbable, that from
this period dates the palace of Mashetta, the fa√ßade of which is
now in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin, as perhaps also
the country houses discovered by Musil in the land of Moab.
Walid also caused the mosque of Medina to be enlarged. For
this purpose, the apartments of the Prophet and his wives were
demolished, which at first caused much discontent in Medina,
some crying out that thereby a verse of the Book of God (S. 49,
v. 4) was cancelled. With this exception, the citizens of Medina
had nothing to complain of. The vicegerent of Abdalmalik
had treated them harshly. Walid immediately on his accession
appointed as governor of Hejaz his cousin Omar b. Abdalaz&#299;z,
who was received there with joy, his devoutness and gentle
character being well known. But the reputation of Omar
attracted to the two holy cities a great number of the inhabitants
of Irak, who had been deeply involved in the rebellion of Ibn
Ash&lsquo;ath. Hajj&#257;j, however, was not the man to allow the formation
of a fresh nucleus of sedition, and persuaded the caliph to
dismiss Omar in the year 712, and appoint Othman b. &#7716;ayy&#257;n
at Medina and Kh&#257;lid al-Qasr&#299; at Mecca. These two prefects
compelled the refugees to return to Irak, where many of them
were severely treated and even put to death by Hajj&#257;j.</p>

<p>Few people have been so slandered as this great viceroy of the
Orient. In reality he was a man of extraordinary ability, and
accomplished the task committed to him with vigour and energy.
To his unflagging constancy was due the suppression of the
dangerous rebellion of Ibn Ash&lsquo;ath. After the restoration of
peace his capacity for organization was displayed in all directions.
The draining and tilling of submerged or uncultivated land on a
large scale, the promotion of agriculture in every way, in particular
by the digging of channels, and the regulation of the
system of taxation, were carried out on his initiative. He
showed the utmost wisdom in the selection of his lieutenants.
The fear of his name was so great that even in the desert there
was security for life and property, and his brilliant military
successes were unquestionably due in a great measure to the
care which he bestowed on equipment and commissariat. The
heavy expenses entailed thereby were largely met by the booty
which he won. Hajj&#257;j was a sincere Moslem; this, however,
did not prevent him from attacking Ibn Zobair in the Holy
City, nor again from punishing rebels, though they bore the
name of holy men. He enjoyed the entire confidence of Abdalmal&#299;k
with Walid, but Suleiman, the appointed successor,
regarded him with disfavour. Yazid b. Mohallab, whom he had
recalled from Khorasan, and imprisoned, had escaped and put
himself under the protection of Suleiman, who made himself
surety for the fine to which Yazid had been condemned. Hajj&#257;j
foreboded evil, and prayed eagerly that he might die before
Walid. His death took place about the end of Ramadan 95
(June or July 714).</p>

<p>7. <i>Reign of Suleiman</i> (<i>Solaiman</i>).&mdash;Suleiman had early missed
the throne. Walid wished to have his son Abdalaz&#299;z chosen as
his successor, and had offered Suleiman a large sum of money to
induce him to surrender his rights. Walid went still further
and sent letters to the governors of all the provinces, calling on
them to take the oath of allegiance to his son. None, except
Hajj&#257;j and his two generals Qotaiba b. Moslim and Mahommed b.
Q√†sim, consented thus to set at naught the order of succession
established by Abdalmalik; and Suleiman succeeded without
difficulty on the death of his brother Jom&#257;da II. 96 (February
715). We can easily conceive the hatred felt by Suleiman for
Hajj&#257;j and for all that belonged to him. Hajj&#257;j himself was
dead; but Suleiman poured out his wrath on his family and his
officers. The governors of Medina and Mecca were dismissed;
Mahommed b. Qasim, the conqueror of India, cousin of Hajj&#257;j,
was dismissed from his post and outlawed. Qotaiba b. Moslim,
the powerful governor of Khorasan, tried to anticipate the caliph
by a revolt, but a conspiracy was formed against him, which
ended in his murder. Some historians say that he was falsely
accused of rebellion.</p>

<p>Yazid b. Mohallab, the enemy of <span class="correction" title="amended from Majjaj">Hajj&#257;j</span>, was made governor
of Irak. His arrival was hailed with joy, especially by the
Azd, to whom his family belonged, and the other Yemenite
tribes. Yazid discovered soon that the system of taxation as
regulated by Hajj&#257;j could not be altered without serious danger
to the finances of the empire, and that he could not afford the
expenses which his prodigal manner of life involved. He therefore
asked the caliph to give him the governorship of Khorasan
also, and took his residence in Merv, where he was free from
control. On his return to Khorasan he set on foot a series of
new expeditions against Jorj&#257;n and Tabarist&#257;n, with only partial
success. He sent, however, to the caliph an exaggerated account
of his victories and the booty he had made. He had cause to
repent this later.</p>

<p>Walid had, in the last years of his reign, made preparations
for a great expedition against Constantinople. Suleiman carried
them on with energy, and as early as the autumn of <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 715
Maslama invaded Asia Minor at the head of a numerous army,
whilst a well-equipped fleet under Omar b. Hobaira sailed out
to second him. It is said that Suleiman was firmly persuaded
that Constantinople would be conquered during his reign, in
accordance with a Sibylline prophecy which said that the city
would be subdued by a caliph bearing the name of a prophet,
he himself being the first to fulfil this condition.<a name="fa20b" id="fa20b" href="#ft20b"><span class="sp">20</span></a> Moreover, the
Byzantine empire was in these years disturbed by internal
troubles. The first year of the expedition was not unsuccessful.
The siege of Amorium in Phrygia was broken up, but Pergamum
and Sardis were taken. On the 25th of August 716 the blockade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span>
of Constantinople began from the land side, and two weeks later
from the sea side. A few months before, Leo the Isaurian had
ascended the throne and prepared the city for the siege. This
lasted about a year. The besieged were hard pressed, but the
besiegers suffered by the severe winter, and were at last obliged
to raise the siege. Maslama brought back the rest of his army
in a pitiful state, while the fleet, on its return, was partly destroyed
by a violent tempest. The Moslems regard this failure
as one of the great evils that have befallen the human race, and
one which retarded the progress of the world for ages,<a name="fa21b" id="fa21b" href="#ft21b"><span class="sp">21</span></a> the other
calamity being the defeat in the battle of Tours by Charles Martel.</p>

<p>Maslama was still on his way back when Suleiman died at
D&#257;biq in northern Syria, which was the base of the expeditions
into Asia Minor. He seems not to have had the firmness of
character nor the frugality of Walid; but he was very severe
against the looseness of manners that reigned at Medina, and was
highly religious. Raj&#257; b. Haywa, renowned for his piety, whose
influence began under Abdalmalik and increased under Walid,
was his constant adviser and even determined him to designate
as his successor his devout cousin Omar b. Abdalaz&#299;z. Suleiman
was kind towards the Alids and was visited by several of them,
amongst others by Abu H&#257;shim, the son of Mahommed b. al
&#7716;anaf&#299;ya, who after his father&rsquo;s death had become the secret
Imam (head) of the Shi&lsquo;ites. On his way back to Hejaz this man
visited the family of Abdallah b. &lsquo;Abb&#257;s, which resided at
&#7716;omaima, a place situated in the vicinity of &lsquo;Amm&#257;n, and died
there, after having imparted to Mahommed b. Ali b. Abdallah b.
Abbas the names of the chiefs of the Shi&lsquo;a in Irak and Khorasan,
and disclosed his way of corresponding with them. From that
time the Abbasids began their machinations against the
Omayyads in the name of the family of the Prophet, avoiding all
that could cause suspicion to the Shi&lsquo;ites, but holding the strings
firmly in their own hands.</p>

<p>8. <i>Reign of Omar II.</i>&mdash;Omar b. Abdalaz&#299;z did his best to
imitate his grandfather Omar in all things, and especially in
maintaining the simple manner of life of the early Moslems. He
was, however, born in the midst of wealth; thus frugality
became asceticism, and in so far as he demanded the same rigour
from his relatives, he grew unjust and caused uneasiness and
discontent. By paying the highest regard to integrity in the
choice of his officers, and not to ability, he did not advance the
interests of his subjects, as he earnestly wished to do. In the
matter of taxes, though actuated by the most noble designs, he
did harm to the public revenues. The principle of Islam was,
that no Moslem, whatever might be his nationality, should pay
any tax other than the <i>zak&#257;t</i> or poor-rate (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan
INSTITUTIONS</a></span>). In practice, this privilege was confined to the
Arabic Moslems. Omar wished to maintain the principle. The
original inhabitants had been left on the conquered lands as
agriculturists, on condition of paying a fixed sum yearly for
each district. If one of these adopted Islam, Omar permitted
him to leave his place, which had been strictly forbidden by
Hajj&#257;j in Irak and the eastern provinces, because by it many
hands were withdrawn from the tilling of the ground, and those
who remained were unable to pay the allotted amount. Omar&rsquo;s
system not only diminished the actual revenue, but largely
increased in the cities the numbers of the <i>maula&rsquo;s</i> (clients),
mainly Persians, who were weary of their dependency on their
Arabic lords, and demanded equal rights for themselves. Their
short dominion in Kufa under Mokht&#257;r had been suppressed, but
the discontent continued. In North Africa particularly, and in
Khorasan the effect of Omar&rsquo;s proclamation was that a great
multitude embraced Islam. When it became necessary to impose
a tribute upon the new converts, great discontent arose, which
largely increased the number of those who followed the Shi&lsquo;ite
preachers of revolt. Conversion to Islam was promoted by the
severe regulations which Omar introduced for the non-believers,
such as Christians and Jews. It was he who issued those humiliating
rescripts, which are commonly but unjustly attributed to
Omar I. But he forbade extortion and suppressed more than
one illegal impost. He endeavoured above all to procure justice
for all his subjects. Complaints against oppression found in him
a ready listener, and many unlawfully acquired possessions were
restored to the legal owners, for instance, to the descendants of
Ali and Tal&#7717;a. Even to the Kharijites he contrived to give
satisfaction, as far as possible. In all these matters he followed
the guidance of divines and devotees, in whose congenial company
he delighted. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at that these
men saw in Omar the ideal of a prince, and that in Moslem
history he has acquired the reputation of a saint.</p>

<p>After the failure of the siege of Constantinople, the advanced
posts in Asia Minor were withdrawn, but the raids were continued
regularly. It has been said that it was Omar&rsquo;s intention to give
up his Spanish conquests, but the facts argue the contrary. The
governor, named by Omar, Sam&#7717; b. Abdallah, even crossed the
Pyrenees and took possession of Narbonne; but he was beaten
and killed at Toulouse in July 720. But Omar did all he could to
prevent the degradation of the Holy War, which, instead of being
the ultimate expedient for the propagation of Islam, if all other
means had failed, had often degenerated into mere pillaging
expeditions against peaceful nations.</p>

<p>9. <i>Reign of Yazid II.</i>&mdash;Omar&rsquo;s reign was as short as that of
his predecessor. He died on the 24th of Rajab 101 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 9th
February 720). Yazid II., son of Abdalmalik and, by his mother
&lsquo;&#256;tika, grandson of Yazid I., ascended the throne without opposition.
He had at once, however, to put down a dangerous
rebellion. Yazid b. Mohallab had returned to Irak, after the
conquest of Jorj&#257;n, when Suleiman was still alive. Shortly after,
Ad&#299; b. Art&#257;t, whom Omar II. had appointed governor, arrived,
arrested Yazid, and sent him to Omar, who called him to account
for the money he had mentioned in his letter to Suleiman, and
imprisoned him when he pretended not to be able to pay the
amount. Yazid II. had personal grounds for ill-will to Yazid b.
Mohallab. One of the wives of the new caliph, the same who
gave birth to that son of Yazid II. who afterwards reigned as
Walid II., was niece to the celebrated &#7716;ajj&#257;j, whose family had
been ill-treated by the son of Mohallab, when he was governor of
Irak under Suleiman. Aware that Yazid b. Abdalmalik, on
ascending the throne, would spare neither him nor his family,
Yazid b. Mohallab had succeeded in escaping to Basra, the home
of his family, where his own tribe the Azd was predominant.
Meanwhile &lsquo;Ad&#299; b. Art&#257;t had all the brothers of Yazid and other
members of the family of Mohallab arrested, and tried to prevent
Yazid from entering the city. But &lsquo;Adi was too scrupulous to
employ the public money for raising the pay of his soldiers,
whilst Yazid promised mountains of gold. Yazid stormed the
castle and took &lsquo;Ad&#299; prisoner, the public treasury fell into his
hands, and he employed the money to pay his troops largely and
to raise fresh ones. A pardon obtained for him from the caliph
came too late; he had already gone too far. He now proclaimed
a Holy War against the Syrians, whom he declared to be worse
enemies of Islam than even the Turks and the Dailam. Notwithstanding
the warnings of the aged Hasan al-Basr&#299;, the friend of
Omar II., the religious people, took the part of Yazid, and were
followed by the <i>maulas</i>. Though the number of his adherents
thus increased enormously, their military value was small.
Ahw&#257;z (Kh&#363;zist&#257;n), F&#257;rs and Kirman were easily subdued, but
in Khorasan the Azd could not prevail over the Tam&#299;m, who were
loyal to the caliph. As the rebellion threatened to spread far and
wide, Yazid II. was obliged to appeal to his brother, the celebrated
Maslama. With the approach of the Syrians, Yazid b. Mohallab
tried to forestall them at Kufa. He took his way over W&#257;sit,
which he mastered&mdash;the Syrian garrison seems to have been
withdrawn in the days of Omar II.&mdash;but, before he could get hold
of Kufa, the Syrian troops arrived. The meeting took place at
&lsquo;Aqr in the vicinity of Babel, and Yazid was completely defeated
and fell in the battle. His brothers and sons fled to Basra;
thence they went by sea to Kirman and then to Kandab&#299;l in
India; but they were pursued relentlessly and slain with only
two exceptions by the officers of Maslama. The possessions of
the Mohallabites were confiscated.</p>

<p>Maslama was rewarded with the governorship of Irak and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span>
Khorasan, but was soon replaced by Omar b. Hobaira, who under
Omar II. had been governor of Mesopotamia. He belonged to
the tribe of Qais, and was very severe against the Azd and other
Yemenite tribes, who had more or less favoured the part of Yazid
b. Mohallab. In these years the antagonism between Qais
(Mo&#7693;ar) and Yemenites became more and more acute, especially
in Khorasan. The real cause of the dismissal of Maslama was,
that he did not send the revenue-quota to Damascus. Omar b.
Hobaira, to supply the deficiency, ordered the prefect of
Khorasan, Sa&lsquo;&#299;d-al-&#7716;arash&#299;, to take tribute from the Sogdians in
Transoxiana, who had embraced Islam on the promise of Omar II.
The Sogdians raised a revolt in Ferghana, but were subdued by
Sa&lsquo;&#299;d and obliged to pay. A still more questionable measure of
Ibn Hobaira was his ordering the successor of Sa&lsquo;&#299;d Harash&#299; to
extort large sums of money from several of the most respectable
Khorasanians. The discontent roused thereby became one of the
principal causes of the fall of the Omayyads.</p>

<p>In Africa serious troubles arose from the same cause. Yazid b.
Abi Moslim, who had been at the head of the financial department
in Irak under &#7716;ajj&#257;j, and had been made governor of Africa by
Yazid II., issued orders that the villagers who, having adopted
Islam, were freed from tribute according to the promise of Omar
II., and had left their villages for the towns, should return to
their domiciles and pay the same tribute as before their conversion.
The Berbers rose in revolt, slaughtered the unfortunate
governor, and put in his place the former governor Mahommed b.
Yazid. The caliph at first ratified this choice, but soon after
dismissed Mahommed from his post, and replaced him by Bishr b.
&#7778;afw&#257;n, who under Hisham made an expedition against Sicily.</p>

<p>Yazid II. was by natural disposition the opposite of his predecessor.
He did not feel that anxiety for the spiritual welfare of
his subjects which had animated Omar II. Poetry and music,
not beloved by Suleiman and condemned by Omar, were held
by him in great honour. Two court-singers, Sall&#257;ma and &#7716;ab&#257;ba,
exercised great influence, tempered only by the austerity of
manners that prevailed in Syria. He was so deeply affected by
the death of &#7716;ab&#257;ba, that Maslama entreated him not to exhibit
his sorrow to the eyes of the public. He died a few days later, on
the 26th of January 724, according to the chroniclers from grief
for her loss. As his successor he had appointed in the first place
his brother Hisham, and after him his own son Walid.</p>

<p>10. <i>Reign of Hisham</i>.&mdash;Hisham was a wise and able prince
and an enemy of luxury, not an idealist like Omar II., nor a
worldling like Yazid II., but more like his father Abdalmalik,
devoting all his energy to the pacification of the interior, and to
extending and consolidating the empire of Islam. But the discontent,
which had been sown under his predecessors, had now
developed to such an extent that he could not suppress it in
detail. His first care was to put an end to the tyrannical rule
of the Qaisites (Mo&#7693;arites) in Irak and Khorasan by dismissing
Omar b. Hobaira and appointing in his place Kh&#257;lid al-Qasr&#299;.
This very able man, who under Hajj&#257;j had been prefect of
Mecca, belonged properly neither to the Qaisites nor to the
Yemenites, but as he took the place of Ibn Hobaira and dismissed
his partisans from their posts, the former considered him
as their adversary, the latter as their benefactor. After his
death, in particular, the Yemenites celebrated him as their chief,
and assigned as the reason for their revolt the injuries which he
suffered. Kh&#257;lid himself assuredly did not intend it. He was a
loyal servant of the dynasty, and remained such even after
receiving very harsh treatment from them. For fifteen years
Kh&#257;lid governed the eastern half of the empire, and continued
to maintain peace with only few exceptions throughout. He
did much for the reclaiming and improving of lands in Irak, in
which the caliph himself and several princes took an active part.
The great revenues obtained thereby naturally caused much
jealousy. Kh&#257;lid lived on a very rich scale and was extraordinarily
liberal, and he was charged with having carried out all
his improvements for his own interests, and upbraided for
selling the corn of his estates only when the prices were high.
To these charges were added the accusation that he was too
tolerant to Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians. As his mother
professed the Christian religion, he was accused of infidelity.
At last a conspiracy, into which the principal engineer of Kh&#257;lid,
Hass&#257;n the Nabataean, had been drawn, succeeded in inciting
Hisham against Kh&#257;lid. They told him that Kh&#257;lid had used
disrespectful terms in speaking of the caliph, and that he had
appropriated revenues belonging to the state. The latter
imputation especially influenced Hisham, who was very parsimonious.
When the dismissal of Kh&#257;lid had been resolved upon,
Y&#363;suf b. Omar, his appointed successor, was sent secretly to
Kufa, where he seized on Kh&#257;lid unawares. For eighteen months
Kh&#257;lid remained in prison. But when he declined even under
torture to confess that he had been guilty of extensive peculation,
he was finally released. He settled at Damascus and made a
noble return for his injuries by taking an active part in the war
against the Greeks. In the summer of <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 740, while he was in
Asia Minor, a great fire broke out in Damascus, the guilt of which
was attributed to Kh&#257;lid. Though it soon appeared that the
imputation was false, Kh&#257;lid, on his return, was furious, and
uttered very offensive words against the caliph. Hisham, however,
would not again punish his old servant; on the contrary,
he seems to have regarded his indignation as a proof of innocence.</p>

<p>The successor of Kh&#257;lid in Irak had not long been in office
when Zaid b. Ali, grandson of Hosain b. Ali, who had come to
Kufa for a lawsuit, was persuaded by the chiefs of the Shi&lsquo;a to
organize a revolt. He succeeded in so far that 15,000 Kufians
swore to fight with him for the maintenance of the commandments
of the Book of God and the <i>Sunna</i> (orthodox tradition) of
his Prophet, the discomfiture of the tyrants, the redress of
injury, and last, not least, the vindication of the family of the
Prophet as the rightful caliphs. The revolt broke out on the
6th of January 740. Unfortunately for Zaid he had to do with
the same Kufians whose fickleness had already been fatal to his
family. He was deserted by his troops and slain. His body was
crucified in Kufa, his head sent to Damascus and thence to
Medina. His son Yahy&#257;, still a youth, fled to Balkh in Khorasan,
but was discovered at last and hunted down, till he fell sword in
hand under Walid II. Abu Moslim, the founder of the Abbasid
dynasty, proclaimed himself his avenger, and on that occasion
adopted the black garments, which remained the distinctive
colour of the dynasty.</p>

<p>In Khorasan also there were very serious disturbances. The
Sogdians, though subdued by Sa&lsquo;&#299;d al &#7716;arash&#299;, were not
appeased, but implored the assistance of the Turks, who had
long been contending earnestly against the Arabs for the
dominion of Transoxiana. They found besides a most valuable
ally in &#7716;&#257;rith b. Soraij, a distinguished captain of the Arabic
tribe of Tam&#299;m, who, with many pious Moslems, was scandalized
by the government&rsquo;s perfidy in regard to the new converts.
&#7716;&#257;rith put himself at the head of all the malcontents, and raised
the black flag, in compliance with a Sibylline prophecy, holding
that the man with the black flag (the Prophet&rsquo;s flag) would put
an end to the tyranny, and be the precursor of the Mahdi.<a name="fa22b" id="fa22b" href="#ft22b"><span class="sp">22</span></a> The
government troops suffered more than one defeat, but in the
last month of the year 118 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 736) the governor Asad al-Qasr&#299;,
the brother of Kh&#257;lid, after having defeated &#7716;&#257;rith,
gained a brilliant victory over the Turks, which finally caused
them to retreat. Asad died almost simultaneously with the
dismissal of Kh&#257;lid. Hisham then separated Khorasan from
Irak and chose as governor of the former Na&#7779;r b. Sayy&#257;r, a
valiant soldier who had grown grey in war, and who, besides all
his other capacities, was an excellent poet. Na&#7779;r instituted a
system of taxation, which, if it had been introduced earlier,
would perhaps have saved the Arabic domination. It was that
which later on was generally adopted, viz. that all possessors
of conquered lands (<i>i.e.</i> nearly the whole empire except Arabia),
whether Moslems or not, should pay a fixed tax, the latter in
addition to pay a poll-tax, from which they were relieved on
conversion to Islam. During the reign of Hisham, Na&#7779;r made
a successful expedition against &#7716;&#257;rith and the Turks. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span>
propaganda of the Shi&lsquo;a by the Abbasids was continued in these
years with great zeal.</p>

<p>In India several provinces which had been converted to Islam
under the Caliphate of Omar II. declared themselves independent,
because the promise of equal rights for all Moslems was not kept
under the reign of his successors. This led to the evacuation of
the eastern part of India (called Hind by the Arabs, Sind being the
name of the western part), and to the founding of the strong cities
of Ma&#7717;f&#363;&#7827;a and Man&#7779;&#363;ra for the purpose of controlling the land.</p>

<p>In the north and north-west of the empire there were no
internal disorders, but the Moslems had hard work to maintain
themselves against the Alans and the Khazars. In the year 112
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 730) they suffered a severe defeat, in which the general
Jarr&#257;h perished. But the illustrious Maslama b. Abdalmalik,
and Merwan b. Mahommed (afterwards caliph), governor of
Armenia and Azerbaijan (Adherbaijan), succeeded in repelling
the Khazars, imposing peace on the petty princes of the eastern
Caucasus, and consolidating the Arab power in that quarter.
The war against the Byzantines was continued with energy
during the whole of Hisham&rsquo;s reign. Moawiya, the son of
Hisham, whose descendants reigned later in Spain, was in command
till 118 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 736), when he met his death accidentally in
Asia Minor by a fall from his horse. After his death, Suleiman,
another son of the caliph, had the supreme command. Both
were eager and valiant warriors. But the hero of all the battles
was Abdallah b. Hosain, surnamed al-Batt&#257;l (the brave). He
has been the subject of many romantic tales. Tabar&#299; tells how
he took the emperor Constantine prisoner in the year 114 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>
732; but Constantine V. Copronymus only began to reign in
740 or 741 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>); another Arabic author places this event in
the year 122, adding that al-Batt&#257;l, having defeated the Greeks,
was attacked and slain in returning with his captives. The
Greek historians say nothing about Constantine having been
made prisoner. It is probable that the Arabs took another
Greek soldier for the prince.<a name="fa23b" id="fa23b" href="#ft23b"><span class="sp">23</span></a> The victories of the Moslems had
no lasting results. During the troubles that began in the reign
of Walid II., the Greeks reconquered Marash (Germanicia),
Malatia (Malatiyeh) and Erzerum (Theodosiopolis).</p>

<p>In Spain the attention of the Moslems was principally turned
to avenge the defeat of Sam&#7717; beyond the Pyrenees. As early as
the second year of the reign of Hisham, &lsquo;Anbasa, the governor of
Spain, crossed the Pyrenees, and pushed on military operations
vigorously. Carcassonne and N√Æmes were taken, Autun sacked.
The death of &lsquo;Anbasa in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 725 and internal troubles put a stop
to further hostilities. The Berbers were the chief contingent of
the Moslem troops, but were treated by their Arab masters as
inferior people. They began to resent this, and one of their
chiefs, Munisa (Munuza), made himself independent in the north
and allied himself with Odo, king of Aquitaine, who gave him his
daughter in marriage. In the year 113 Abdarrahman b. Abdallah
subdued Munisa, crossed the mountains and penetrated into
Gascony by the valley of Roncesvalles. The Moslems beat Odo,
gained possession of Bordeaux, and overran the whole of southern
Gaul nearly as far as the Loire. But in October 732 their march
was checked between Tours and Poitiers by Charles Martel and
after some days of skirmishing a fierce but indecisive battle was
fought. Abdarrahman was among the slain and the Moslems
retreated hastily in the night, leaving their camp to the Franks.
They were, however, not yet discouraged. In 739 the new governor
of Spain, Oqba (Aucupa) b. Hajj&#257;j, a man of high qualities,
re-entered Gaul and pushed forward his raids as far as Lyons,
but the Franks again drove back the Arabs as far as Narbonne.
Thenceforth the continual revolts of the Berbers in Africa, and
the internal troubles which disturbed Spain until the reign of
Abdarrahman I., effectually checked the ambition of the Moslems.</p>

<p>In Africa the hand of government pressed heavily. The
Berbers, though they had pledged themselves to Islam and had
furnished the latest contingents for the Holy War, were treated
as tributary serfs, notwithstanding the promises given by
Omar II. The Kharijites, of whom a great many had emigrated
to Africa, found them eager listeners. Still, they could not
believe that it was according to the will of the caliph that they
<span class="correction" title="amended from here">were</span> thus treated, until a certain number of their chiefs went as a
deputation to Hisham, but failed to obtain an audience. Thereupon
a fierce insurrection broke out, against which the governor
of Africa was powerless. Hisham at once sent an army of more
than 30,000 men, under the command of Kolthum al-Qoshair&#299;,
and Balj b. Bishr. Not far from the river Sabu in Algeria,<a name="fa24b" id="fa24b" href="#ft24b"><span class="sp">24</span></a> the
meeting with the army of the insurgents took place (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 740).
Kolth&#363;m was beaten and killed; Balj b. Bishr led the rest of the
Syrian army to Ceuta, and thence, near the end of 741, to Spain,
where they aided in the suppression of the dangerous revolt of the
peninsular Berbers. Balj died in 742. A year later the governor,
Abu&rsquo;l-Kha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;r, assigned to his troops for settlement divers
countries belonging to the public domain.<a name="fa25b" id="fa25b" href="#ft25b"><span class="sp">25</span></a> An effort of the
African Berbers to make themselves masters of Kairawan failed,
their army being utterly defeated by the governor &#7716;an&#7827;ala.</p>

<p>Hisham died in February 743, after a reign of twenty years.
He had not been wanting in energy and ability, and kept the reins
of the government in his own hands. He was a correct Moslem
and tolerant towards Christians and Jews. His financial administration
was sound and he guarded against any misuse of the
revenues of the state. But he was not popular. His residence
was at Ro&#7779;&#257;fa on the border of the desert, and he rarely admitted
visitors into his presence; as a rule they were received by his
chamberlain Abrash. Hisham tried to keep himself free from
and above the rival parties, but as his vicegerents were inexorable
in the exaction of tribute, the Qaisites against the Yemenites,
the Yemenites against the Qaisites, both parties alternately had
reason to complain, whilst the non-Arabic Moslems suffered
under the pressure and were dissatisfied. He caused a large
extent of land to be brought into cultivation, and many public
works to be executed, and he was accused of overburdening his
subjects for these purposes. Therefore, Yazid III. (as also the
Abbasids) on taking office undertook to abstain from spending
money on building and digging. The principle that a well-filled
treasury is the basis of a prosperous government was pushed by
him too far. Notwithstanding his activity and his devotion to
the management of affairs, the Moslem power declined rather
than advanced, and signs of the decay of the Omayyad dynasty
began to show themselves. The history of his four successors,
Walid II., Yazid III., Ibrahim and Merwan II., is but the history
of the fall of the Omayyads.</p>

<p>11. <i>Reign of Walid II.</i>&mdash;Walid II. was a handsome man,
possessed of extraordinary physical strength, and a distinguished
poet. But Hisham, to whom he was successor-designate,
foolishly kept him in the background, and even made earnest
efforts to get his own son Maslama acknowledged as his successor.
Walid therefore retired to the country, and passed his time there
in hunting, cultivating poetry, music and the like, waiting with
impatience for the death of Hisham and planning vengeance on
all those whom he suspected of having opposed him. His first
public action was to increase the pay of all soldiers by 10
dirhems, that of the Syrians by 20. The Omayyads who came to
pay their respects to him received large donations. Many
philanthropic institutions were founded. As to the family of his
predecessor, he contented himself with confiscating their possessions,
with the single exception of Suleiman b. Hisham, whom he
had whipped and put in prison. But the Makhz&#363;mites, who were
related to Hisham by his mother, he deprived of all their power
and had them tortured to death. The vicegerents of Hisham
were replaced by Qaisites; Yusuf b. Omar, the governor of Irak,
being a Qaisite, was not only confirmed in his office, but received
with it the supreme command of Khorasan. He made use of it
immediately by ordering Na&#7779;r b. Sayy&#257;r to collect a rich present
of horses, falcons, musical instruments, golden and silver vessels
and to offer it to the caliph in person, but before the present was
ready the news came that Walid had been murdered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span></p>

<p>It is not certain that Walid also suspected Kh&#257;lid al-Qasr&#299; of
having intrigued against him. But Yusuf b. Omar did not rest
until he had his old enemy in his power. It is said that he
guaranteed Walid a large sum of money, which he hoped to
extort from Kh&#257;lid. This unfortunate man died under torture,
which he bore with fortitude, in Muharram 126 (November
743).</p>

<p>Walid designated his two sons as heirs to the Caliphate.
These were still under age and were not the children of a freeborn,
noble mother. Both circumstances, according to the then
prevailing notions, made them unfit for the imamate. Moreover,
it was an affront, in particular, for the sons of Walid I., who
already had considered the nomination of Yazid II. as a slight to
themselves. A conspiracy arose, headed by Yazid b. Walid I.,
and joined by the majority of the Merwanid princes and many
Kalbites and other Yemenites who regarded the ill-treatment of
Kh&#257;lid al-Qasr&#299; as an insult to themselves. Various stories were
circulated about the looseness of Walid&rsquo;s manner of life; Yazid
accused him of irreligion, and, by representing himself as a
devout and God-fearing man, won over the pious Moslems. The
conspirators met with slight opposition. A great many troops
had been detached by Hisham to Africa and other provinces, the
caliph himself was in one of his country places; the prefect of
Damascus also was absent. Without difficulty, Yazid made
himself master of Damascus, and immediately sent his cousin
Abdalaz&#299;z with 2000 men against Walid, who had not more than
200 fighting men about him. A few men hastened to the rescue,
among others &lsquo;Abb&#257;s b. Walid with his sons and followers.
Abdalaz&#299;z interrupted his march, took him prisoner and compelled
him to take the oath of allegiance to his brother Yazid. Walid&rsquo;s
small body of soldiers was soon overpowered. After a valiant
combat, the caliph retired to one of his apartments and sat
with the Koran on his knee, in order to die just as Othman
had died. He was killed on the 17th of April 744. His head
was taken to Damascus and carried about the city at the end of
a spear.</p>

<p>On the news of the murder of the caliph, the citizens of &#7716;oms
(Emesa) put at their head Abu Mahommed as-Sofi&#257;n&#299;, a grandson
of Yazid I., and marched against Damascus. They were beaten
by Suleim&#257;n b. Hish&#257;m at a place called Solaim&#257;n&#299;a, 12 m. from
the capital. Abu Mahommed was taken prisoner and shut up
with several of his brethren and cousins in the Khadr&#257;, the old
palace of Moawiya, together with the two sons of Walid II. One
or two risings in Palestine were easily suppressed. But the
reigning family had committed suicide. Their unity was broken.
The holiness of their Caliphate, their legitimate authority, had
been trifled with; the hatred of the days of Merj R&#257;hi&#7789; had been
revived. The orthodox faith also, whose strong representative
and defender had hitherto been the caliph, was shaken by the
fact that Yazid III. belonged to the sect of the Qadaris who
rejected the doctrine of predestination. The disorganization of
the empire was at hand.</p>

<p>12. <i>Reign of Yazid III.</i>&mdash;Yazid III., on his accession, made a
fine speech, in which he promised to do all that could be expected
from a good and wise ruler, even offering to make place immediately
for the man whom his subjects should find better
qualified for the Caliphate than himself. He cancelled, however,
the increase of the pay granted by Walid and thus earned the
nickname of the <i>N&#257;qi&#7779;</i> (diminisher). As he owed his position to
the aid of the Kalbites, he chose his officers from among them.
The governorship of Irak was confided to a Kalbite, Man&#7779;&#363;r b.
Jomh&#363;r, a hot-headed and unscrupulous man. Y&#363;suf b. Omar
was unable to offer resistance, and was ultimately taken and
confined in the Khadr&#257;. Man&#7779;&#363;r had hardly been three months
in office when Yazid replaced him by Abdallah, son of Omar II.
The distant provinces, with the exception of Sind and Sijistan,
renounced the authority of the new caliph. In Africa Abdarrahman
b. Hab&#299;b, a descendant of the famous &lsquo;Oqba b. N&#257;f&#299;&rsquo;, was
almost independent. In Spain every amir tried to free himself
from a suzerainty which appeared to him only nominal. Na&#7779;r b.
Sayy&#257;r, the governor of Khorasan, had not yet decided whether
he ought to take the oath of allegiance when Yazid died, after a
reign of only five months and a half, on the 12th of Dhu&rsquo;l-&#7716;ijja
<span class="sc">a.h.</span> 126 (25th September <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 744).</p>

<p>13.  Yazid III. left his brother Ibr&#257;h&#299;m as his successor. He
was acknowledged as caliph only in a part of Syria, and reigned
no longer than two months, when he was obliged to abdicate and
to submit to the authority of Merwan II.</p>

<p>14.  Merwan II., the son of Mahommed b. Merwan and cousin
of Maslama, was a man of energy, and might have revived the
strength of the Omayyad dynasty, but for the general disorder
which pervaded the whole empire. In 732 Hisham had entrusted
to him the government of Armenia and Azerbaijan, which he
held with great success till the death of Walid II. He had great
military capacity and introduced important reforms. On the
murder of Walid he prepared to dispute the supreme power with
the new caliph, and invaded Mesopotamia. Yazid III., in
alarm, offered him as the price of peace the government of this
province  together with Armenia and Azerbaijan. Merwan
resolved to accept those conditions, and sent a deputation to
Damascus, which, however, had just reached Manbij (Hierapolis)
when Yazid died. Leaving his son Abdalmalik with 40,000
men in Rakka, Merwan entered Syria with 80,000 men. Suleim&#257;n
b. Hish&#257;m, at the head of 120,000 men, was defeated at &lsquo;Ain
al-Jarr, between Baalbek and Damascus. Merwan made many
prisoners, whom he treated with the greatest mildness, granting
them freedom on condition that they should take the oath of
allegiance to the sons of Walid II. He then marched upon
Damascus. But Suleim&#257;n b. Hish&#257;m, Yazid, the son of Kh&#257;lid
al-Qasri, and other chiefs, hastened to the Khadr&#257; and killed the
two princes, together with Y&#363;suf b. Omar. Suleiman then made
himself master of the treasury and fled with the caliph Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
to Tadmor (Palmyra). Only Abu Mahommed as-Sofi&#257;n&#299; escaped
the murderers. When Merwan entered Damascus this man
testified that the sons of Walid II., who had just become adult,
had named Merwan successor to the Caliphate, and was the first
to greet him as Prince of the Believers. All the generals and
officers followed his example and took the oath of allegiance
(7th December <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 744). Merwan did all he could to pacify
Syria, permitting the Arabs of the four provinces to choose
their own prefects, and even acquiescing in the selection as
prefect of Palestine of Th&#257;bit b. No&lsquo;aim, who had behaved very
treacherously towards him before, but whom he had forgiven.
He did not, however, wish to reside in Damascus, but transplanted
the seat of government to his own town, Harran in
Mesopotamia. Suleiman b. Hisham  and Ibrahim  tendered
their submission and were pardoned.</p>

<p>But the pacification was only on the surface. Many Omayyad
princes considered Merwan as an upstart, his mother being a
slave-girl; the Damascenes were angry because he had chosen
Harran for his residence; the Kalbites felt themselves slighted,
as the Qaisites predominated. Th&#257;bit b. No&lsquo;aim revolted in
Palestine, Emesa (Homs) and Tadmor were turbulent, Damascus
was besieged by Yazid b. Kh&#257;lid al Qasr&#299;. Merwan, who wanted
to march against Irak, was obliged to return to Syria, where he
put an end to the troubles. This time Th&#257;bit b. No&lsquo;aim had to
pay for his perfidy with his life. After this new pacification,
Merwan caused the Syrians to acknowledge his two sons as heirs
to the Caliphate, and married them to two daughters of Hish&#257;m.
All the Omayyad princes were invited to the wedding, Merwan
hoping still to conciliate them. He then equipped 10,000
Syrians, and ordered them to rejoin the army of 20,000 men
from Kinnesrin (Qinnasr&#299;n) and Mesopotamia, who, under Yazid
b. Omar b. Hobaira, were already on the march towards Irak.
When these Syrians came to Ro&#7779;&#257;fa (Rusafa), Suleim&#257;n b.
Hish&#257;m persuaded them to proclaim himself caliph, and made
himself master of Kinnesrin. From all sides Syrians flocked to
his aid till he had 70,000 men under his orders. Merwan immediately
ordered Ibn Hobaira to stop his march and to wait for
him at D&#363;r&#299;n, and marched with the main force against Suleim&#257;n,
whom he utterly defeated at Khos&#257;f in the district of Kinnesrin.
Suleiman fled to Homs and thence to Tadmor and on to Kufa,
leaving his brother Sa&lsquo;id in Homs. The siege of this place by
Merwan lasted nearly five months. After the victory the walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>39</span>
were demolished, and likewise those of Baalbek, Damascus,
Jerusalem and other towns. Syria was utterly crushed, and
therewith the bulwark of the dynasty was destroyed. Not until
the summer of 128 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 746) could Merwan resume his campaign
against Irak.</p>

<p>The governor of this province, Abdallah, the son of Omar II.,
was a man of small energy, whose principal care was his personal
ease and comfort. An ambitious man, Abdallah b. Moawiya, a
great-grandson of Ali&rsquo;s brother Ja&lsquo;far, put himself at the head of
a band of Shi&lsquo;ites and <i>maulas</i>, made himself master of Kufa and
marched upon Hira, where, since Y&#363;suf b. Omar, the governor
and the Syrian troops had resided. The rebels were defeated,
and Kufa surrendered (October 744) under condition of amnesty
for the insurgents and freedom for Abdallah b. Moawiya. This
adventurer now went into Media (Jabal), where a great number
of <i>maulas</i> and Shi&lsquo;ites, even members of the reigning dynasty
and of the Abbasid family, such as the future caliph Mansur,
rejoined him. With their help he became master of a vast
empire, which, however, lasted scarcely three years.</p>

<p>Ibn Omar did not acknowledge Merwan as caliph. For the
moment Merwan could do no more than send a new governor,
Ibn Sa&lsquo;&#299;d al &#7716;arash&#299;. This officer was supported only by the
Qaisite troops, the Kalbites, who were numerically superior,
maintaining Ibn Omar in his residence at Hira. There were
many skirmishes between them, but a common danger soon
forced them to suspend their hostilities. The general disorder
after the death of Hisham had given to the Khawarij an opportunity
of asserting their claims such as they had never had
before. They belonged for the greater part to the Rab&#299;&lsquo;a, who
always stood more or less aloof from the other Arabs, and had a
particular grudge against the Mo&#7693;ar. Their leading tribe, the
Shaib&#257;n, possessed the lands on the Tigris in the province of
Mosul, and here, after the murder of Walid II., their chief
proclaimed himself caliph. Reinforced by many Kharijites out
of the northern provinces, he marched against Kufa. Ibn Omar
and Ibn Sa&lsquo;i&#273; al &#7716;arash&#299; tried to defend their province, but
were completely defeated. &#7716;arash&#299; fled to Merwan, Ibn Omar
to Hira, which, after a siege of two months, he was obliged to
surrender in Shaww&#257;l 127 (August <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 745). Man&#7779;u&#345; b. Jomh&#363;r
was the first to pass over to the Khawarij; then Ibn Omar
himself took the oath of allegiance. That a noble Koreishite,
a prince of the reigning house, should pledge himself to follow
&#7692;a&#7717;&#7717;&#257;k the Shaib&#257;nite as his Imam, was an event of which
the Khawarij were very proud. Ibn Omar was rewarded with
the government of eastern Irak, Kh&#363;zist&#257;n and F&#257;rs.</p>

<p>Whilst Merwan besieged Homs, &#7692;a&#7717;&#7717;&#257;k returned to Mesopotamia
and took Mosul, whence he threatened Nisibis, where
Abdallah, the son of Merwan, maintained himself with difficulty.
Suleim&#257;n b. Hish&#257;m also had gone over to the Khawarij, who
now numbered 120,000 men. Mesopotamia itself was in danger,
when Merwan at last was able to march against the enemy. In a
furious battle at Kafart&#363;tha (September <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 746) the Khawarij
were defeated; &#7692;a&#7717;&#7717;&#257;k and his successor Khaibar&#299; perished;
the survivors were obliged to retire to Mosul, where they crossed
the Tigris. Merwan followed them and encamped on the
western bank. Immediately after the battle of Kafart&#363;tha,
Yazid b. Omar b. Hobaira directed his troops towards Irak. He
beat the Kharijites repeatedly and entered Kufa in May or June
747. Ibn Omar was taken prisoner; Man&#7779;&#363;r b. Jomh&#363;r fled to
Ibn Moawiya. Ibn Hobaira was at last free to send Ibn &#7692;ob&#257;ra
with an army to Mesopotamia. At his approach the Kharijites
left their camp and fled to Abdallah b. Moawiya, who was now at
the height of his power. But it was not destined to last. The
two generals of Ibn Hobaira, Ibn &#7692;ob&#257;ra and Nob&#257;ta b. &#7716;an&#7827;ala
defeated his army; Ibn Moawiya fled to Khorasan, where he met
his death; the chief of the Kharijites, Shaib&#257;n Yashkori went to
eastern Arabia; Suleim&#257;n b. Hish&#257;m and Man&#7779;&#363;r b. Johm&#363;r
escaped to India. Thus, at last, the western and south-eastern
parts of the empire lay at the feet of Merwan. But in the north-east,
in Khorasan, meanwhile a storm had arisen, against which
his resources and his wisdom were alike of no avail.</p>

<p>When the news of the murder of Walid II. reached Khorasan,
Na&#7779;r b. Sayy&#257;r did not at once acknowledge the Caliphate of
Yazid III., but induced the Arab chiefs to accept himself as amir
of Khorasan, until a caliph should be universally acknowledged.
Not many months later (Shaww&#257;l 126) he was confirmed in his
post by Yusuf b. Omar, the governor of Irak. But Na&#7779;r had a
personal enemy, the chief of the Azd (Yemenites) Jodai&rsquo; al-Kirm&#257;n&#299;,
a very ambitious man. A quarrel arose, and in a short
time the Azd under Kirm&#257;n&#299;, supported by the Rab&#299;&lsquo;a, who
always were ready to join the opposition, were in insurrection,
which Na&#7779;r tried in vain to put down by concessions.</p>

<p>So stood matters when &#7716;&#257;rith b. Soraij, seconded by Yazid III.,
reappeared on the scene, crossed the Oxus and came to Merv.
Na&#7779;r received him with the greatest honour, hoping to get his aid
against Kirm&#257;n&#299;, but &#7716;&#257;rith, to whom 3000 men of his tribe, the
Tam&#299;m, had gone over, demanded Na&#7779;r&rsquo;s abdication and tried to
make himself master of Merv. Having failed in this, he allied
himself with Kirm&#257;n&#299;. Na&#7779;r could hold Merv no longer, and
retired to Nishapur. But the Tam&#299;m of &#7716;&#257;rith could not endure
the supremacy of the Azd. In a moment the allies were divided
into two camps; a battle ensued, in which &#7716;&#257;rith was defeated
and killed. Originally, &#7716;&#257;rith seems to have had the highest
aims, but in reality he did more than any one else to weaken the
Arabic dominion. He brought the Turks into the field against
them; he incited the native population of Transoxiana against
their Arab lords, and stirred up discord between the Arabs
themselves. Being a Tam&#299;mite, he belonged to the Mo&#7693;ar, on
whom the government in Khorasan depended; but he aided the
Yemenites to gain the upper hand of them. Thus he paved the
way for Abu Moslim.</p>

<p>Since the days of Ali there had been two tendencies among the
Shi&lsquo;ites. The moderate party distinguished itself from the other
Moslems only by their doctrine that the imamate belonged
legally to a man of the house of the Prophet. The other party,
that of the ultra-Shi&lsquo;ites, named H&#257;shim&#299;ya after Abu H&#257;shim
the son of Mahommed b. al-&#7716;anaf&#299;ya, preached the equality of all
Moslems, Arabs or non-Arabs, and taught that the same divine
spirit that had animated the Prophet, incorporated itself again
in his heirs (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Shi'ites</a></span>). After the death of Hosain, they chose
for their Imam Mahommed b. al-&#7716;anaf&#299;ya, and at his decease his
son Abu H&#257;shim, from whom Mahommed b. Ali, the grandson of
Abdallah b. Abbas, who resided at &#7716;omaima in the south-east of
Syria, obtained the secrets of the party and took the lead (<span class="sc">a.h.</span>
98, see above). This Mahommed, the father of the two first
Abbasid caliphs, was a man of unusual ability and great ambition.
He directed his energies primarily to Khorasan. The missionaries
were charged with the task of undermining the authority of the
Omayyads, by drawing attention to all the injustices that took
place under their reign, and to all the luxury and wantonness of
the court, as contrasted with the misery of many of their subjects.
God would not suffer it any longer. As soon as the time was ripe
that time could not be far off&mdash;He would send a saviour&mdash;and
out of the house of the Prophet, the Mahdi, who would restore
Islam to its original purity. All who desired to co-operate in
this holy purpose must pledge themselves to unlimited obedience
to the Imam, and place their lives and property at his disposal. As
a proof of their sincerity they were required at once to pay a fixed
sum for the Imam. The missionaries had great success, especially
among the non-Arabic inhabitants of Khorasan and Transoxiana.</p>

<p>Mahommed b. Ali died <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 126 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 743-744), and his son
Ibrah&#299;m, the Imam, took his place. Ibrah&#299;m had a confidant
about whose antecedents one fact alone seems certain, that he
was a <i>maula</i> (client) of Persian origin. This man, Abu Moslim by
name, was a man of real ability and devoted to his master&rsquo;s
cause. To him, in 745-746, the management of affairs in Khorasan
was entrusted, with instructions to consult in all weighty matters
the head of the mission, the Arab Suleim&#257;n b. Kath&#299;r. At first
the chiefs of the mission were by no means prepared to recognize
Abu Moslim as the plenipotentiary of the heir of the Prophet.
In the year 129 he judged that the time for open manifestation
had arrived. His partisans were ordered to assemble from all sides
on a fixed day at S&#299;qadenj in the province of Merv. Then, on the
1st Shaww&#257;l (15th June 747), the first solemn meeting took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
place and the black flags were unfolded. On that occasion
Suleim&#257;n b. Kath&#299;r was still leader, but by the end of the year
Abu Moslim, whom the majority believed to belong himself to
the family of the Prophet, was the acknowledged head of a strong
army. Meantime, Na&#7779;r had moved from Nishapur to Merv, and
here the two Arabic armies confronted each other. Then, at last,
the true significance of Abu Moslim&rsquo;s work was recognized. Na&#7779;r
warned the Arabs against their common enemy, &ldquo;who preaches
a religion that does not come from the Envoy of God, and whose
chief aim is the extirpation of the Arabs.&rdquo; In vain he had
entreated Merwan and Ibn Hobaira to send him troops before it
should be too late. When at last it was possible to them to fulfil
his wish, it was in fact too late. For a moment it seemed as
though the rival Arab factions, realizing their common peril,
would turn their combined forces against the Shi&lsquo;ites. But Abu
Moslim contrived to re-awaken their mutual distrust and jealousy,
and, taking advantage of the opportunity, made himself master
of Merv, in Rabia II. <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 130 (December 747). Na&#7779;r escaped only
by a headlong flight to Nishapur. This was the end of the Arabic
dominion in the East. Many Arab chiefs were killed, partly by
order of Abu Moslim, partly by their clients. The latter, however,
was strictly forbidden by Abu Moslim. So severe indeed was the
discipline he exercised, that one of the chief missionaries, who by
a secret warning had rendered possible the escape of Na&#7779;r from
Merv, paid for it with his life.</p>

<p>As soon as Abu Moslim had consolidated his authority, he sent his
chief general Qa&#7717;&#7789;aba against Nishapur. Na&#7779;r&rsquo;s son Tam&#299;m
was vanquished and killed, and Na&#7779;r retreated to Kumis (Q&#363;mis)
on the boundary of Jorj&#257;n, whither also advanced from the other
side Nob&#257;ta at the head of an army sent by Merwan. Qa&#7717;&#7789;aba
detached his son &#7716;asan against Na&#7779;r and went himself to meet
Nob&#257;ta, whom he beat on the 1st of Dhu&rsquo;l-&#7717;ijja 130 (6th August
748). Na&#7779;r could not further resist. He reached S&#257;w&#257; in the
vicinity of Hamadan, where he died quite exhausted, at the age of
eighty-five years. Rei and Hamadan were taken without serious
difficulty. Near Nehawend, Ibn &#7692;ob&#257;ra, at the head of a large
army, encountered Qa&#7717;&#7789;aba, but was defeated and killed. In
the month of Dhu&rsquo;l-qa&lsquo;da 131 (June 749) Nehawend (Nehavend)
surrendered, and thereby the way to Irak lay open to Qa&#7717;&#7789;aba.
Ibn Hobaira was overtaken and compelled to retire to W&#257;sit.
Qa&#7717;&#7789;aba himself perished in the combat, but his son &#7716;asan
entered Kufa without any resistance on the 2nd of September 740.</p>

<p>Merwan had at last discovered who was the real chief of the
movement in Khorasan, and had seized upon Ibrah&#299;m the Imam
and imprisoned him at Harran. There he died, probably from
the plague, though Merwan was accused of having killed him.
When the other Abbasids left &#7716;omaima is not certain. But they
arrived at Kufa in the latter half of September 749, where in the
meantime the head of the propaganda, Abu Salama, called the
wazir of the family of Mahomet, had previously undertaken the
government. This Abu Salama seems to have had scruples
against recognizing Abu&rsquo;l-Abbas as the successor of his brother
Ibrah&#299;m, and to have expected that the Mahdi, whom he looked
for from Medina, would not be slow in making his appearance,
little thinking that an Abbasid would present himself as such.
But Abu Jahm, on the instructions of Abu Moslim, declared to
the chief officers of the Khorasanian army that the Mahdi was in
their midst, and brought them to Abu&rsquo;l-Abbas, to whom they
swore allegiance. Abu Salama also was constrained to take the
oath. On Friday, the 12th Rabia II. <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 132 (28th November
749) Abu&rsquo;l-Abbas was solemnly proclaimed caliph in the principal
mosque of Kufa. The trick had been carried out admirably. On
the point of gathering the ripe fruit, the Alids were suddenly
pushed aside, and the fruit was snatched away by the Abbasids.
The latter gained the throne and they took good care never to be
deprived of it.</p>

<p>After the conquest of Nehawend, Qa&#7717;&#7789;aba had detached one
of his captains, Abu &lsquo;Aun, to Shahraz&#363;r, where he defeated the
Syrian army which was stationed there. Thereupon Abu &lsquo;Aun
occupied the land of Mosul, where he obtained reinforcements
from Kufa, headed by Abdallah b. Ali, an uncle of Abu&rsquo;l-Abbas,
who was to have the supreme command. Merwan advanced
to meet him, and was completely defeated near the Greater Zab,
an affluent of the Tigris, in a battle which lasted eleven days.
Merwan retreated to Harran, thence to Damascus, and finally to
Egypt, where he fell in a last struggle towards the end of 132
(August 750). His head was cut off and sent to Kufa.<a name="fa26b" id="fa26b" href="#ft26b"><span class="sp">26</span></a> Abu
Aun, who had been the real leader of the campaign against
Merwan, remained in Egypt as its governor. Ibn Hobaira,
who had been besieged in Wasit for eleven months, then consented
to a capitulation, which was sanctioned by Abu&rsquo;l-Abbas.
Immediately after the surrender, Ibn Hobaira and his principal
officers were treacherously murdered. In Syria, the Omayyads
were persecuted with the utmost rigour. Even their graves were
violated, and the bodies crucified and destroyed. In order that
no members of the family should escape, Abdallah b. Ali
pretended to grant an amnesty to all Omayyads who should come
in to him at Abu Fotros (Antipatris) and acknowledge the new
caliph, and even promised them the restitution of all their property.
Ninety men allowed themselves to be entrapped, and Abdallah
invited them to a banquet. When they were all collected, a
body of executioners rushed into the hall and slew them with
clubs. He then ordered leathern covers to be thrown upon the
dying men, and had the banquet served upon them. In Medina
and Mecca Da&rsquo;ud b. Ali, another uncle of Abu&rsquo;l-Abbas, conducted
the persecution; in Ba&#7779;ra, Suleiman b. Ali. Abu&rsquo;l-Abbas
himself killed those he could lay his hands on in Hira and Kufa,
amongst them Suleim&#257;n b. Hish&#257;m, who had been the bitterest
enemy of Merwan. Only a few Omayyads escaped the massacre,
several of whom were murdered later. A grandson of Hisham,
Abdarrahm&#257;n, son of his most beloved son Moawiya, reached
Africa and founded in Spain the Omayyad dynasty of Cordova.</p>

<p>With the dynasty of the Omayyads the hegemony passes
finally from Syria to Irak. At the same time the supremacy of
the Arabs came to an end. Thenceforth it is not the contingents
of the Arabic tribes which compose the army, and on whom the
government depends; the new dynasty relies on a standing
army, consisting for the greater part of non-Arabic soldiers.
The barrier that separated the Arabs from the conquered nations
begins to crumble away. Only the Arabic religion, the Arabic
language and the Arabic civilization maintain themselves, and
spread more and more over the whole empire.</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">C.&mdash;The Abbasids</p>

<p>We now enter upon the history of the new dynasty, under
which the power of Islam reached its highest point.</p>

<p>1. Abu&rsquo;l-Abbas inaugurated his Caliphate by a harangue
in which he announced the era of concord and happiness which
was to begin now that the House of the Prophet had been
restored to its right. He asserted that the Abbasids were the
real heirs of the Prophet, as the descendants of his oldest uncle
Abbas. Addressing the Kufians, he said, &ldquo;Inhabitants of Kufa,
ye are those whose affection towards us has ever been constant
and true; ye have never changed your mind, nor swerved from
it, notwithstanding all the pressure of the unjust upon you. At
last our time has come, and God has brought you the new era.
Ye are the happiest of men through us, and the dearest to us.
I increase your pensions with 100 dirhems; make now your
preparations, for I am the lavish shedder of blood<a name="fa27b" id="fa27b" href="#ft27b"><span class="sp">27</span></a> and the
avenger of blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these fine words, Abu&rsquo;l-Abbas did not trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>
the Kufians. He resided outside the town with the Khorasanian
troops, and with them went first to Hira, then to H&#257;shim&#299;ya,
which he caused to be built in the neighbourhood of Anbar.
For their real sympathies, he knew, were with the house of Ali,
and Abu Salama their leader, who had reluctantly taken the oath
of allegiance, did not conceal his disappointment. Abu Jahm,
the vizier (<i>q.v.</i>; also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan Institutions</a></span>), or &ldquo;helper,&rdquo;
of Abu Moslim, advised that Abu Ja&lsquo;far, the caliph&rsquo;s brother,
should be sent to Khorasan to consult Abu Moslim. The result
was that Abu Salama was assassinated, and at the same time
Suleim&#257;n b. Kath&#299;r, who had been the head of the propaganda
in Khorasan, and had also expected that the Mahdi would belong
to the house of Ali. It is said that Abu Ja&lsquo;far, whilst in Khorasan,
was so impressed by the unlimited power of Abu Moslim, and
saw so clearly that, though he called his brother and himself
his masters, he considered them as his creatures, that he vowed
his death at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>The ruin of the Omayyad empire and the rise of the new
dynasty did not take place without mighty convulsions. In
Bathan&#299;ya and the &#7716;aur&#257;n, in the north of Syria, in Mesopotamia
and Irak Khorasan insurrections had to be put down
with fire and sword. The new caliph then distributed the
provinces among the principal members of his family and his
generals. To his brother Abu Ja&lsquo;far he gave Mesopotamia,
Azerbaijan and Armenia; to his uncle Abdallah b. Ali, Syria;
to his uncle Da&rsquo;ud, Hejaz, Yemen and Yam&#257;ma (Yemama);
to his cousin &lsquo;&#298;s&#257; b. M&#363;s&#257;, the province of Kufa. Another uncle,
Suleim&#257;n b. Ali, received the government of Ba&#7779;ra with Bahrein
and Oman; Ism&#257; &lsquo;&#299;l b. Ali that of Ahw&#257;z; Abu Moslim, Khorasan
and Transoxiana; Mahommed b. Ash&lsquo;ath, F&#257;rs; Abu &lsquo;Aun,
Egypt. In Sind the Omayyad governor, Man&#7779;&#363;r b. Jomh&#363;r,
had succeeded in maintaining himself, but was defeated by an
army sent against him under M&#363;s&#257; b. Ka&lsquo;b, and the black
standard of the Abbasids was raised over the city of Man&#7779;&#363;ra.
Africa and Spain are omitted from this catalogue, because the
Abbasids never gained any real footing in Spain, while Africa
remained, at least in the first years, in only nominal subjection
to the new dynasty. In 754 Abu Moslim came to Irak to visit
Abu&rsquo;l-Abbas and to ask his permission to make the pilgrimage
to Mecca. He was received with great honour, but the caliph
said that he was sorry not to be able to give him the leadership
of the pilgrimage, which he had already purposely entrusted to
his brother, Abu Ja&lsquo;far.</p>

<p>Abu&rsquo;l-Abbas died on the 13th of Dhu&lsquo;l-&#7717;ijja 136 (5th June
754). He seems to have been a man of limited capacity, and
had very little share in the achievements accomplished in his
name. He initiated practically nothing without the consent of
Abu Jahm, who was thus the real ruler. In the few cases where
he had to decide, he acted under the influence of his brother
Abu Ja&lsquo;far.</p>

<p>2. <i>Reign of Mansur.</i>&mdash;Abu&lsquo;l-Abbas had designated as his
successors first Abu Ja&lsquo;far, surnamed al-Man&#7779;&#363;r (the victorious),
and after him his cousin &lsquo;&#298;s&#257; b. M&#363;s&#257;. Abu Ja&lsquo;far was, according
to the historians, older than Abu&lsquo;l-Abbas, but while the mother
of the latter belonged to the powerful Yemenite tribe of al-&#7716;&#257;rith
b. Ka&lsquo;b, the mother of Abu Ja&lsquo;far was a Berber slave-girl.
But he was a son of Mahommed b. Ali, and was therefore preferred
by Abu Moslim to his uncles and cousins. Abu&lsquo;l-Abbas,
however, had promised the succession to his uncle Abdallah b.
Ali, when he marched against Merwan. When the news of the
death of Abu&lsquo;l-Abbas reached Abdallah, who at the head of a
numerous army was on the point of renewing the Byzantine war,
he came to Harran, furious at his exclusion, and proclaimed
himself caliph. Abu Moslim marched against him, and the two
armies met at Nisibis, where, after a number of skirmishes, a
decisive engagement took place (28th November 754). Abdallah
was defeated and escaped to Ba&#7779;ra, where he found a refuge with
his brother Suleim&#257;n. A year later he asked for pardon, and
took the oath of allegiance to Mansur. The caliph spared his
life for a time, but he did not forget. In 764 Abdallah met his
death by the collapse of his house, which had been deliberately
undermined.</p>

<p>The first care of Mansur was now to get rid of the powerful Abu
Moslim, who had thus by another brilliant service strengthened
his great reputation. On pretence of conferring with him on
important business of state, Mansur induced him, in spite of
the warnings of his best general, Abu Na&#7779;r, to come to Mad&#257;in
(Ctesiphon), and in the most perfidious manner caused him to be
murdered by his guards. Thus miserably perished the real
founder of the Abbasid dynasty, the <i>&#7778;&#257;&#7717;ib addaula</i>, as he is
commonly called, the <i>Am&#299;n</i> (trustee) of the House of the Prophet.
A witty man, being asked his opinion about Abu Ja&lsquo;far (Mansur)
and Abu Moslim, said, alluding to the Koran 21, verse 22, &ldquo;if
there were two Gods, the universe would be ruined.&rdquo; The
Khorasanian chiefs were bribed into submission, and order was at
last re-established by Mansur&rsquo;s general Kh&#257;zim b. Khozaima in
Mesopotamia, and by Abu D&#257;&rsquo;&#363;d, the governor of Khorasan in
the east.</p>

<p>About the same time Africa<a name="fa28b" id="fa28b" href="#ft28b"><span class="sp">28</span></a> and Spain escaped from the
dominion of the eastern Caliphate; the former for a season,
the latter permanently. The cause of the revolt of Africa was
as follows. Mansur had written to Abdarrahm&#257;n, announcing
the death of Abu&lsquo;l-Abbas, and requiring him to take the oath of
allegiance. Abdarrahm&#257;n sent in his adhesion, together with a
few presents of little value. The caliph replied by a threatening
letter which angered Abdarrahm&#257;n. He called the people together
at the hour of prayer, publicly cursed Mansur from the
pulpit and declared him deposed. He next caused a circular
letter, commanding all Maghribins to refuse obedience to the
caliph, to be read from the pulpit throughout the whole extent
of the Maghrib (western North Africa). A brother of Abdarrahm&#257;n,
Ily&#257;s, saw in this revolt an opportunity of obtaining the
government of Africa for himself. Seconded by many of the
inhabitants of Kairawan, who had remained faithful to the cause
of the Abbasids, he attacked his brother, slew him, and proclaimed
himself governor in his stead. This revolution in favour
of the Abbasids was, however, not of long duration. &#7716;ab&#299;b,
the eldest son of Abdarrahm&#257;n, who had fled in the night of his
father&rsquo;s murder, was captured, but the vessel which was to convey
him to Spain having been detained by stress of weather, his
partisans took arms and rescued him. Ily&#257;s was marching
against them, when the idea occurred to &#7716;ab&#299;b of challenging
him to single combat. Ily&#257;s hesitated, but his own soldiers
compelled him to accept the challenge. He measured arms
with &#7716;ab&#299;b, and was slain. The party of independence thus
triumphed, but in the year 144 (761) Mahommed b. Ash&lsquo;ath,
the Abbasid general, entered Kairawan and regained possession
of Africa in the name of the eastern caliph. From the year 800, it must
be added, Africa only nominally belonged to the Abbasids; for, under the
reign of Harun al-Rashid, Ibrah&#299;m b. al-Aghlab, who was invested with
the government of Africa, founded in that province a distinct dynasty,
that of the Aghlabites.</p>

<p>At the same time as the revolt in Africa, the independent Caliphate of
the western Omayyads was founded in Spain. The long dissensions which
had preceded the fall of that dynasty in the East had already prepared
the way for the independence of a province so distant from the centre of
the empire. Every petty amir then tried to seize sovereign power for
himself, and the people groaned under the consequent anarchy. Weary of
these commotions, the Arabs of Spain at last came to an understanding
among themselves for the election of a caliph, and their choice fell
upon one of the last survivors of the Omayyads, Abdarrahm&#257;n b. Moawiya,
grandson of the caliph Hish&#257;m. This prince was wandering in the deserts
of Africa, pursued by his implacable enemies, but everywhere protected
and concealed by the desert tribes, who pitied his misfortunes and
respected his illustrious origin. A deputation from Spain sought him out
in Africa and offered him the Caliphate, which he accepted with joy. On
the 1st Rabia I. 138 (14th August 755) Abdarrahm&#257;n landed in the Iberian
peninsula, where he was universally welcomed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
speedily founded at Cordova the Western Omayyad Caliphate
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spain</a></span>: <i>History</i>).</p>

<p>While Mansur was thus losing Africa and Spain, he was trying
to redeem the losses the empire had sustained on the northern
frontier by the Byzantines. In 750-751 the emperor Constantine
V. (Copronymus) had unsuccessfully blockaded Malatia; but
five years later he took it by force and razed its wall to the ground.
Mansur now sent in 757 an army of 70,000 men under the command
of his cousin Abdalwahh&#257;b, the son of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m the Imam,
whom he had made governor of Mesopotamia, the real chief
being Hasan b. Qa&#7717;&#7789;aba. They rebuilt all that the emperor
had destroyed, and made this key of Asia Minor stronger than
ever before. The Moslems then made a raid by the pass of
&#7716;adath (Adata) and invaded the land of the Byzantines. Two
aunts of the caliph took part in this expedition, having made a
vow that if the dominion of the Omayyads were ended they
would wage war in the path of God. Constantine advanced
with a numerous army, but was afraid of attacking the invaders.
The Moslems also rebuilt Mopsuestia. But from 758 till 763
Mansur was so occupied with his own affairs that he could not
think of further raids.</p>

<p>In 758 (others say in 753 or 754) a body of 600 sectaries, called
R&#257;wend&#299;s (<i>q.v.</i>), went to H&#257;shim&#299;ya, the residence of the caliph,
not far from Kufa. They believed that the caliph was their
lord, to whom they owed their daily bread, and came to pay him
divine honours. They began by marching in solemn procession
round the palace, as if it had been the Ka&lsquo;ba. Mansur being told
of it said: &ldquo;I would rather they went to hell in obedience to
us, than to heaven in disobedience.&rdquo; But as they grew tumultuous,
and he saw that this impious homage gave offence to his
men, he caused the principal leaders to be seized and thrown
into prison. The R&#257;wend&#299;s immediately rose in revolt, broke
the prison doors, rescued their chiefs, and returned to the palace.
The unfortunate fanatics were hunted down and massacred to
the last man, and thereby the ties that bound the Abbasids to
the ultra-Shi&lsquo;ites were severed. From that time forward the
Abbasid caliphs became the maintainers of orthodox Islam,
just as the Omayyads had been. The name of H&#257;shim&#299;ya, which
the reigning family still retained, was henceforward derived
not from Abu H&#257;shim, but from H&#257;shim, the grandfather of
Abbas, the great-grandfather of the Prophet.</p>

<p>A much greater danger now threatened Mansur. In the last
days of the Omayyads, the Shi&lsquo;ites had chosen as caliph,
Mahommed b. Abdallah b. Hasan, whom they called the Mahdi
and the &ldquo;pure soul,&rdquo; and Mansur had been among those who
pledged themselves to him by oath. Not unnaturally, the Alids
in Medina were indignant at being supplanted by the Abbasids,
and Mansur&rsquo;s chief concern was to get Mahommed into his
power. Immediately after his occupying the throne, he named
Ziy&#257;d b. Obaidallah governor of Medina, with orders to lay
hands on Mahommed and his brother Ibr&#257;h&#299;m, who, warned
betimes, took refuge in flight. In 758 Mansur, informed that a
revolt was in preparation, came himself to Medina and ordered
Abdallah to tell him where his sons were. As he could not or
would not tell, he together with all his brothers and some other
relatives were seized and transported to Irak, where Abdallah
and his brother Ali were beheaded and the others imprisoned.
Notwithstanding all these precautions, a vast conspiracy was
formed. On the same day Mahommed was to raise the standard
of revolt in Medina, Ibr&#257;h&#299;m in Ba&#7779;ra. But the Alids, though
not devoid of personal courage, never excelled in politics or in
tactics. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 762 Mahommed took Medina and had himself
proclaimed caliph. The governor of Kufa, &lsquo;Is&#257; b. M&#363;s&#257;, received
orders to march against him, entered Arabia, and captured
Medina, which, fortified by Mahommed by the same means as the
Prophet had employed against the besieging Meccans, could not
hold out against the well-trained Khorasanians. Mahommed
was defeated and slain. His head was cut off and sent to Mansur.
When on the point of death, Mahommed gave the famous sword
of the Prophet called Dhu&lsquo;l-Fiq&#257;r to a merchant to whom he
owed 400 dinars. It came later into the possession of Harun
al-Rashid. In the meanwhile Ibr&#257;h&#299;m had not only gained
possession of Ba&#7779;ra, Ahw&#257;z and F&#257;rs, but had even occupied
W&#257;sit. The empire of the Abbasids was in great jeopardy. For
fifty days Mansur stayed in his room, neither changing his
clothes nor allowing himself a moment&rsquo;s repose. The greater
part of his troops were in Rei with his son al-Mahdi, who had
conquered Tabaristan, in Africa, with Mahommed b. Ash&lsquo;ath,
and in Arabia with &lsquo;&#298;s&#257; b. M&#363;s&#257;. Had Ibr&#257;h&#299;m marched at once
against Kufa he might have crushed Mansur, but he let slip the
opportunity. A terrible conflict took place at B&#257;-Khamra,
48 m. from Kufa. &#7716;omaid b. Qa&#7717;&#7789;aba, the commander
of Mansur&rsquo;s army, was defeated, only a small division under
&lsquo;&#298;s&#257; b. M&#363;s&#257; holding its ground. At that moment Salm,
the son of the famous Qotaiba b. Moslim, came to the rescue by
attacking the rear of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m. &#7716;omaid rallied his troops, and
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m was overpowered. At last he fell, pierced by an arrow,
and, in spite of the desperate efforts of his followers, his body
remained in the hands of the enemy. His head was cut off and
brought to Mansur.</p>

<p>Mansur could now give his mind to the founding of the new
capital. When the tumult of the R&#257;wend&#299;s took place he saw
clearly that his personal safety was not assured in H&#257;shim&#299;ya,<a name="fa29b" id="fa29b" href="#ft29b"><span class="sp">29</span></a>
where a riot of the populace could be very dangerous, and his
troops were continually exposed to the perverting influence of the
fickle and disloyal citizens of Kufa. He had just made choice of
the admirable site of the old market-town of Bagdad when the
tidings came of the rising of Mahommed in Medina. In those
days he saw that he had been very imprudent to denude himself
of troops, and decided to keep henceforth always with him a body
of 30,000 soldiers. So Bagdad, or properly &ldquo;the round city&rdquo; of
Mansur, on the western bank of the Tigris, was built as the
capital. Strictly it was a huge citadel, in the centre of which
was the palace of the caliph and the great mosque. But around
this nucleus there soon grew up the great metropolis which was
to be the centre of the civilized world as long as the Caliphate
lasted.<a name="fa30b" id="fa30b" href="#ft30b"><span class="sp">30</span></a> The building lasted three years and was completed in
the year 149 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 766). That year is really the beginning of the
new era. &ldquo;The Omayyads,&rdquo; says the Spanish writer Ibn &#7716;azm,
&ldquo;were an Arabic dynasty; they had no fortified residence, nor
citadel; each of them dwelt in his villa, where he lived before
becoming caliph; they did not desire that the Moslems should
speak to them as slaves to their master, nor kiss the ground
before them or their feet; they only gave their care to the
appointment of able governors in the provinces of the empire.
The Abbasids, on the contrary, were a Persian dynasty, under
which the Arab tribal system, as regulated by Omar, fell to
pieces; the Persians of Khorasan were the real rulers, and the
government became despotic as in the days of Chrosroes.&rdquo; The
reign of Abu&lsquo;l-Abbas and the first part of that of Mansur had been
almost a continuation of the former period. But now his equals
in birth and rank, the Omayyads and the Alids, had been crushed;
the principal actors in the great struggle, the leaders of the
propaganda and Abu Moslim were out of the way; the caliph
stood far above all his subjects; and his only possible antagonists
were the members of his own family.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&#298;s&#257; b. M&#363;s&#257; had been designated, as we have seen, by Abu&lsquo;l-Abbas
as successor to Mansur. The latter having vainly tried
to compel &lsquo;&#298;s&#257; to renounce his right of succession, in favour of
Mansur&rsquo;s son Mahommed al-Mahdi, produced false witnesses who
swore that he had done so. However unwillingly, &lsquo;&#298;s&#257; was
obliged at last to yield, but it was understood that, in case of
Mahommed&rsquo;s death, the succession should return to &lsquo;&#298;s&#257;. One of
the false witnesses was, it is asserted, Kh&#257;lid b. Barmak, the
head of that celebrated family the Barmecides (<i>q.v.</i>), which
played so important a part in the reign of Harun al-Rashid.
This Kh&#257;lid, who was descended from an old sacerdotal family
in Balkh, and had been one of the trusty supporters of Abu
Moslim, Mansur appointed as minister of finance.</p>

<p>A son of Mahommed the Alid had escaped to India, where,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
with the connivance of the governor Omar b. Hafs Hazarmerd,
he had found refuge with an Indian king. Mansur discovered
his abode, and caused him to be killed. His infant son was sent
to Medina and delivered to his family. Omar Hazarmerd lost
his government and received a command in Africa, where he
died in 770.</p>

<p>In <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 158 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 775) Mansur undertook a pilgrimage to
Mecca, but succumbed to dysentery at the last station on the
route. He was about sixty-five years of age, and had reigned
for twenty-two years. He was buried at Mecca. He was a man
of rare energy and strength of mind. His ambition was boundless
and no means, however perfidious, were despised by him. But
he was a great statesman and knew how to choose able officers
for all places. He was thrifty and anxious to leave to his son a
full treasury. He seems to have cherished the ideal that this son,
called Mahommed b. Abdallah, after the Prophet, should fulfil
the promises of peace and happiness that had been tendered to
the believers, and therefore to have called him al-Mahdi. For
that purpose it was necessary that he should have the means not
only to meet all state expenses, but also to be bounteous. But
from the report of the historian Haitham b. &lsquo;Ad&#299;<a name="fa31b" id="fa31b" href="#ft31b"><span class="sp">31</span></a> about the last
discourse which father and son had together, we gather that the
former had misgivings in regard to the fulfilment of his wishes.</p>

<p>Khalid b. Barmak took the greatest care of the revenues, but
contrived at the same time to consult his own interests. Mansur
discovered this in the same year in which he died, and threatened
him with death unless he should pay to the treasury three millions
of dirhems within three days. Khalid already had so many
friends that the sum was brought together with the exception of
30,000 dirhems. At that moment tidings came about a rising in
the province of Mosul, and a friend of Khalid said to the caliph
that Khalid was the only man capable of putting it down.
Thereupon Mansur overlooked the deficiency and gave Khalid
the government of Mosul. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said a citizen of that town,
&ldquo;we had such an awe and reverence for Khalid, that he appeased
the disorders, almost without punishing anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3. <i>Reign of Mahdi.</i>&mdash;As soon as Mansur was dead, Rabi&rsquo;, his
client and chamberlain, induced all the princes and generals who
accompanied the caliph, to take the oath of allegiance to his son
Mahommed al-Mahdi, who was then at Bagdad. Isa b. Musa
hesitated, but was compelled to give in. In 776 Mahdi constrained
him for a large bribe to renounce his right of succession in favour
of his sons, Musa and Harun. Mansur wrote in his testament to
his son that he had brought together so much money that, even
if no revenue should come in for ten years, it would suffice for all
the wants of the state. Mahdi, therefore, could afford to be
munificent, and in order to make his accession doubly welcome to
his subjects, he began by granting a general amnesty to political
prisoners. Among these was a certain Ya&rsquo;qub b. Da&rsquo;ud, who,
having insinuated himself into the confidence of the caliph,
especially by discovering the hiding places of certain Alids, was
afterwards (in 778) made prime minister. The provincial
governors in whom his father had placed confidence, Mahdi
superseded by creatures of his own.</p>

<p>In Khorasan many people were discontented. The promises
made to them during the war against the Omayyads had not been
fulfilled, and the new Mahdi did not answer at all to their ideal.
A revolt in 160 under the leadership of a certain Yusuf b. Ibrah√Øm,
surnamed al-Barm, was suppressed by Yazid b. Mazyad, who,
after a desperate struggle, defeated Yusuf, took him prisoner and
brought him in triumph to Bagdad, where he with several of his
officers was killed and crucified. In the following year, Mahdi was
menaced by a far more dangerous revolt, led by a sectary, known
generally as Mokanna (<i>q.v.</i>), or &ldquo;the veiled one,&rdquo; because he
always appeared in public wearing a mask. He took up his abode
in the Transoxianian province of Kish and Nakhshab, where he
gathered around him a great number of adherents. After some
successes, the pretender was ultimately cornered at the castle of
Sanam near Kish, and took poison together with all the members
of his family. His head was cut off and sent to Mahdi in the year
163.</p>

<p>Mahdi had been scarcely a year on the throne when he resolved
to accomplish the pilgrimage to Mecca. The chroniclers relate
that on this occasion for the first time camels loaded with ice for
the use of the caliph came to Mecca. Immediately on his arrival
in the Holy City he applied himself, at the request of the inhabitants,
to the renewal of the curtains which covered the exterior
walls of the Ka&lsquo;ba. For a very long time no care had been taken
to remove the old covering when a new one was put on; and the
accumulated weight caused uneasiness respecting the stability of
the walls. Mahdi caused the house to be entirely stripped and
anointed with perfumes, and covered the walls again with a single
cloth of great richness. The temple itself was enlarged and
restored. On this occasion he distributed considerable largesses
among the Meccans. From Mecca Mahdi went to Medina, where
he caused the mosque to be enlarged, and where a similar distribution
of gifts took place. During his stay in that city he formed for
himself a guard of honour, composed of 500 descendants of the
Ans&#257;r,<a name="fa32b" id="fa32b" href="#ft32b"><span class="sp">32</span></a> to whom he assigned a quarter in Bagdad, named after
them the Qat&#299;&lsquo;a (Fief) of the Ans&#257;r. Struck by the difficulties
of every kind which had to be encountered by poor pilgrims to
Mecca from Bagdad and its neighbourhood, he ordered Yaqt&#299;n,
his freedman, to renew the milestones, to repair the old reservoirs,
and to dig wells and construct cisterns at every station of the
road where they were missing. He also had new inns built and
decayed ones repaired. Yaqt&#299;n remained inspector of the road
till 767.</p>

<p>During the reign of Mansur the annual raids against the
Byzantines had taken place almost without intermission, but
the only feat of importance had been the conquest of Laodicea,
called &ldquo;the burnt&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="hae katakekaumenae">&#7969; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;</span>), by Ma&lsquo;y&#363;f b. Yahy&#257; in
the year 770. At first the armies of Mahdi were not successful.
The Greeks even conquered Marash (Germanicia) and annihilated
the Moslem army sent from D&#257;biq. In 778, however, Hasan b.
Qa&#7717;&#7789;aba made a victorious raid as far as Adhr&#363;liya (Dorylaeum);
it was on his proposition that Mahdi resolved on building the
frontier town called &#7716;adath (Adata), which became an outpost.
In 779 the caliph decided on leading his army in person. He
assembled his army in the plains of Barad&#257;n north of Bagdad
and began his march in the early spring of 780, taking with him
his second son H&#257;r&#363;n, and leaving his elder son M&#363;s&#257; as his
lieutenant in Bagdad. Traversing Mesopotamia and Syria, he
entered Cilicia, and established himself on the banks of the Jihan
(Pyramus). Thence he despatched an expeditionary force, nominally
under the command of H&#257;r&#363;n, but in reality under that
of his tutor, the Barmecide Yahy&#257; b. Kh&#257;lid. H&#257;r&#363;n captured
the fortress Sam&#257;lu after a siege of thirty-eight days, the inhabitants
surrendering on condition that they should not be killed or
separated from one another. The caliph kept faith with them,
and settled them in Bagdad, where they built a monastery called
after their native place. In consequence of this feat, Mahdi made
H&#257;r&#363;n governor of the whole western part of the empire, including
Azerbaijan and Armenia. Two years later war broke out afresh
between the Moslems and the Greeks. Leo IV., the East
Roman emperor, had recently died, leaving the crown to Constantine
VI. This prince being only ten years old, his mother Irene
acted as regent and assumed the title Augusta. By her orders
an army of 90,000 men, under the command of Michael Lachanodrakon,
entered Asia Minor. The Moslems, on their side, invaded
Cilicia under the orders of Abdalkab&#299;r who, being afraid of
encountering the enemy, retired with his troops. Irritated by
this failure, the caliph in 781 sent H&#257;r&#363;n, accompanied by his
chamberlain Rab&#299;&rsquo;, with an army of nearly 100,000 men, with
orders to carry the war to the very gates of Constantinople. The
patrician Nicetas, count of Opsikion, who sought to oppose his
march, was defeated by H&#257;r&#363;n&rsquo;s general, Yazid b. Mazyad, and
put to flight. H&#257;r&#363;n then marched against Nicomedia, where he
vanquished the domesticus, the chief commander of the Greek
forces, and pitched his camp on the shores of the Bosporus.
Irene took alarm, sued for peace, and obtained a truce for three
years, but only on the humiliating terms of paying an annual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>
tribute of 90,000 denarii, and supplying the Moslems with guides
and markets on their way home. This brilliant success so
increased Mahdi&rsquo;s affection for H&#257;r&#363;n that he appointed him
successor-designate after M&#363;s&#257; and named him <i>al-Rash&#299;d</i> (&ldquo;the
follower of the right cause&rdquo;). Three years later, he resolved
even to give to him the precedence in the succession instead of
M&#363;s&#257;, yielding to the importunity of Khaizor&#257;n, the mother of
the two princes, and to his own predilection. It was necessary
first to obtain from M&#363;s&#257; a renunciation of his rights; and for
that purpose he was recalled from Jorj&#257;n, where he was engaged
on an expedition against the rebels of Tabarist&#257;n. M&#363;s&#257;,
informed of his father&rsquo;s intentions, refused to obey this order,
and Mahdi determined to march in person against him. But,
after his arrival at M&#257;sabadh&#257;n, a place in Jabal (Media, the later
Persian Irak), he died suddenly, at the age of only forty-three.
Some attribute his death to an accident met with in hunting;
others believe him to have been poisoned. Some European
scholars have suspected M&#363;s&#257; of having been concerned in it, but
of this we have no proof whatever.</p>

<p>The reign of Mahdi was a time of great prosperity. Much was
done for the organization of the huge empire; agriculture and
commerce flourished; the revenues were increasing, whilst the
people fared well. The power of the state was acknowledged even
in the far east: the emperor of China, the king of Tibet, and
many Indian princes concluded treaties with the caliph. He was
an ardent champion of the orthodox faith, repudiating all the
extravagant doctrine preached by the Abbasid missionaries and
formerly professed by his father. In particular he persecuted
mercilessly the Manichaeans and all kinds of freethinkers.</p>

<p>4.  <i>Reign of H&#257;d&#299;</i>.&mdash;On the death of Mahdi, H&#257;r&#363;n, following
the advice of Yahy&#257;. b. Kh&#257;lid, sent the insignia of the Caliphate,
with letters of condolence and congratulation, to M&#363;s&#257; in Jorj&#257;n,
and brought the army which had accompanied Mahdi peacefully
back from Media to Bagdad.  M&#363;s&#257; returned in all haste to the
capital, and assumed the title of <i>al-H&#257;d&#299;</i> (&ldquo;he who directs&rdquo;).
The accession of a new caliph doubtless appeared to the partisans
of the house of Ali a favourable opportunity for a rising. Hosain
b. Ali b. Hasan III. raised an insurrection at Medina with the
support of numerous adherents, and proclaimed himself caliph.
Thence he went to Mecca, where on the promise of freedom many
slaves flocked to him, and many pilgrims also acknowledged him.
Suleim&#257;n b. Mansur, the caliph&rsquo;s representative in the pilgrimage
of that year, was entrusted with the command against him.
Hosain was attacked at Fakh, 3 m. from Mecca, and perished in
the combat with many other Alids. His maternal uncle, Idr&#299;s b.
Abdallah, a brother of Mahommed and Ibr&#257;h&#299;m, the rivals of
Mansur, succeeded in escaping, and fled to Egypt, whence by the
help of the postmaster, himself a secret partisan of the Shi&lsquo;ites,
he passed into West Africa, where at a later period his son founded
the Idrisite dynasty in Fez (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Morocco</a></span>).</p>

<p>H&#257;d&#299;, who had never been able to forget that he had narrowly
escaped being supplanted by his brother, formed a plan for
excluding him from the Caliphate and transmitting the succession
to his own son Ja&lsquo;far. To this he obtained the assent
of his ministers and the principal chiefs of his army, with the
exception of Yahy&#257; b. Kh&#257;lid, H&#257;r&#363;n&rsquo;s former tutor, who showed
such firmness and boldness that H&#257;d&#299; cast him into prison and
resolved on his death. Some historians say that he had already
given orders for his execution, when he himself was killed
(September 14th, 786) by his mother Khaizor&#257;n, who had
systematically and successfully intrigued against him with the
object of gaining the real power for herself. H&#257;d&#299;, indignant at
the fact that she was generally regarded as the real source of
authority, had attempted to poison her, and Khaizor&#257;n, hoping
to find a more submissive instrument of her will in her second
and favourite son, caused H&#257;d&#299; to be smothered with cushions by
two young slaves whom she had presented to him. She herself
died three years later.</p>

<p>5.  <i>Reign of H&#257;r&#363;n al-Rash&#299;d</i>.&mdash;We have now reached the most
celebrated name among the Arabian caliphs, celebrated not only
in the East, but in the West as well, where the stories of the
<i>Thousand and One Nights</i> have made us familiar with that world
which the narrators represent in such brilliant colours. H&#257;r&#363;n
ascended the throne without opposition. His first act was to
choose as prime minister his former tutor, the faithful Yahy&#257; b.
Kh&#257;lid, and to confide important posts to the two sons of Yahy&#257;,
Fa&#7693;l and Ja&lsquo;far, of whom the former was his own foster-brother,
the latter his intimate friend. The Barmecide family were
endowed in the highest degree with those qualities of generosity
and liberality which the Arabs prized so highly, and the chronicles
never weary in their praises. Loaded with all the burdens of
government, Yahy&#257; brought the most distinguished abilities to
the exercise of his office. He put the frontiers in a good state of
defence; he filled the public treasury, and carried the splendour
of the throne to the highest point. His sons, especially Fa&#7693;l,
were worthy of their father.</p>

<p>Although the administration of H√£r&#363;n&rsquo;s states was committed
to skilful hands, yet the first years of his long reign were not free
from troubles. Towards the year 176 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 792-793) a man of the
house of Ali, named Yahy&#257; b. Abdallah, another brother of
Mahommed and Ibr&#257;h&#299;m, who had taken refuge in the land of
Dailam on the south-western shores of the Caspian Sea, succeeded
in forming a powerful party, and publicly claimed the Caliphate.
H√£r&#363;n immediately sent against him an army of 50,000 men,
under the command of Fa&#7693;l, whom he made governor of all the
Caspian provinces. Reluctant, however, to fight against a
descendant of the Prophet, Fa&#7693;l first attempted to induce him
to submit by promising him safety and a brilliant position at the
court of Bagdad. Yahy&#257;accepted the proposal, but required
that the caliph should send him letters of pardon countersigned
by the highest legal authorities and the principal personages of
the empire. H&#257;r&#363;n consented and Yahy&#257; went to Bagdad,
where he met with a splendid reception. At the end of some
months, however, he was calumniously accused of conspiracy,
and the caliph, seizing the opportunity of ridding himself of a
possible rival, threw him into prison, where he died, according to
the majority of the historians, of starvation. Others say that
Ja&lsquo;far b. Yahy&#257; b. Kh&#257;lid, to whose care he had been entrusted,
suffered him to escape, and that this was the real cause of H&#257;r&#363;n&rsquo;s
anger against the Barmecides (<i>q.v.</i>). Dreading fresh insurrections
of the Alids, H&#257;r&#363;n secured the person of another descendant of
Ali, M&#363;s&#257; b. Ja&lsquo;far, surnamed al-K&#257;zim, who enjoyed great
consideration at Medina, and had already been arrested and
released again by Mahdi. The unfortunate man was brought by
the caliph himself to Bagdad, and there died, apparently by
poison.</p>

<p>Meanwhile H&#257;r&#363;n did not forget the hereditary enemy of
Islam. In the first year of his reign all the strong places of
Kinnesrin and Mesopotamia were formed into a special province,
which received the name of al-&lsquo;Aw&#257;&#7779;im (&ldquo;the defending fortresses&rdquo;),
with Manbij (Hierapolis) as its capital. The building
of the fortress of Hadath having been completed, H&#257;r&#363;n committed
to Faraj the Turk the task of rebuilding and fortifying the
city of Tarsus. Thanks to these and similar measures, the Moslem
armies were able to advance boldly into Asia Minor. Almost
every year successful raids were made, in the year 797 under the
command of the caliph himself, so that Irene was compelled to
sue for peace. An attack by the Khazars called the caliph&rsquo;s
attention from his successes in Asia Minor. This people had
made an irruption into Armenia, and their attack had been so
sudden that the Moslems and Christians were unable to defend
themselves, and 100,000 had been reduced to captivity. Two
valiant generals, Khozaima b. Kh&#257;z&#299;m and Yaz&#299;d b. Mazyad,
marched against the Khazars and drove them out of Armenia.</p>

<p>In the midst of the cares of war, H&#257;r&#363;n was assiduous in his
religious duties, and few years passed without his making the
pilgrimage. Having determined to fix the order of succession in
so formal a manner as to take away all pretext for future contentions,
he executed a deed by which he appointed his eldest son
Mahommed his immediate heir, and after him the second,
Abdallah, and after Abdallah the third, Q&#257;sim. Mahommed
received the surname of <i>al-Am&#299;n</i> (&ldquo;the Sure&rdquo;), Abdallah that
of <i>al-Ma&lsquo;m&#363;n</i> (&ldquo;he in whom men trust&rdquo;), and Q&#257;sim that of
<i>al-Mo&rsquo;tamin bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who trusts in God&rdquo;). H&#257;r&#363;n further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span>
stipulated that Mamun should have as his share during the lifetime
of his brother the government of the eastern part of the
empire. Each of the parties concerned swore to observe faithfully
every part of this deed, which the caliph caused to be hung up in
the Ka&lsquo;ba, imagining that it would be thus guaranteed against all
violation on the part of men, a precaution which was to be rendered
vain by the perfidy of Am&#299;m.</p>

<p>It was in the beginning of the following year, at the very
moment when the Barmecides thought their position most secure,
that H&#257;r&#363;n brought sudden ruin upon them. The causes of
their disgrace have been differently stated by the annalists (see
BARMECIDES). The principal cause appears to have been that
they abused the sovereign power which they exercised. Not a
few were jealous of their greatness and sought for opportunities
of instilling distrust against them into the mind of H&#257;r&#363;n, and of
making him feel that he was caliph only in name. The secret
dissatisfaction thus aroused was increased, according to some
apparently well-informed authorities, by the releasing of the
Alid Yahy&#257; b. Abdallah, already mentioned. Finally H&#257;r&#363;n
resolved on their destruction, and Ja&lsquo;far b. Yahy&#257;, who had just
taken leave of him after a day&rsquo;s hunting, was arrested, taken to
the castle of H&#257;r&#363;n, and beheaded. The following day, his father
Yahy&#257;, his brother Fadl, and all the other Barmecides were
arrested and imprisoned; all their property was confiscated.
The only Barmecide who remained unmolested with his family
was Mahommed the brother of Yahy&#257;, who had been the chamberlain
of the caliph till 795, when Fadl b. Rabi&rsquo; got his place.
This latter had henceforward the greatest influence at court.</p>

<p>In the same year a revolution at Constantinople overthrew the
empress Irene. The new emperor Nicephorus, thinking himself
strong enough to refuse the payment of tribute, wrote an insulting
letter to H&#257;r&#363;n, who contented himself with replying: &ldquo;Thou
shall not hear, but see, my answer.&rdquo; He entered Asia Minor and
took Heraclea, plundering and burning along his whole line of
march, till Nicephorus, in alarm, sued for peace. Scarcely had
the caliph returned into winter quarters when Nicephorus broke
the treaty. When the news came to Rakka, where H&#257;r&#363;n was
residing, not one of the ministers ventured to tell him, until at
last a poet introduced it in a poem which pleased the monarch.
Notwithstanding the rigour of the season, H&#257;r&#363;n retraced his
steps, and Nicephorus was compelled to observe his engagements.
In 805 the first great ransoming of Moslem prisoners took place
on the banks of the little river Lamus in Cilicia. But Nicephorus,
profiting by serious disturbances in Khorasan, broke the treaty
again, and overran the country as far as Anazarba and Kan&#299;sat
as-saud&#257; (&ldquo;the black church&rdquo;) on the frontier, where he took
many prisoners, who were, however, recovered by the garrison of
Mopsuestia. Thus H&#257;r&#363;n was obliged to take the field again.
He entered Asia Minor with an army of 135,000 regulars, beside
volunteers and camp followers. Heraclea was taken, together
with many other places, and Tyana was made a military station.
At the same time his admiral, Homaid b. Ma&lsquo;y&#363;f, conquered
Cyprus, which had broken the treaty, and took 16,000 of its
people captive. Nicephorus was now so completely beaten that
he was compelled to submit to very harsh conditions. In the
year 808 the second ransoming between the Moslems and the
Greeks took place near the river Lamus.</p>

<p>The disturbances in Khorasan were caused by the malversations
of the governor of that province, Ali b. &lsquo;&#298;s&#257; b. M&#257;h&#257;n.
The caliph went in person to Merv, in order to judge of the
reality of the complaints which had reached him. Ali b. &lsquo;&#298;s&#257;
hastened to meet the caliph on his arrival at Rai (Rhagae),
near the modern Teheran, with a great quantity of costly
presents, which he distributed with such profusion among the
princes and courtiers that no one was anxious to accuse him.
H&#257;r&#363;n confirmed him in his post, and, after having received the
chiefs of Tabarist&#257;n who came to tender their submission,
returned through Bagdad to Rakka on the Euphrates, which
city was his habitual residence. In the following year R&#257;fi&rsquo; b.
Laith, a grandson of Nasr b. Sayy&#257;r, raised the standard of revolt
in Samarkand, and, at the head of a numerous army, defeated
the son of Ali b. &lsquo;&#298;s&#257;. Thereupon Ali fled from Balkh, leaving
the treasury, which was plundered by the populace after his
departure. The caliph on learning that the revolt was due to
Ali&rsquo;s tyranny, sent Harthama b. A&lsquo;yan with stringent orders
to seize Ali and confiscate his possessions. This order was carried
out, and it is recorded that 1500 camels were required to transport
the confiscated treasures. The caliph&rsquo;s hope that R&#257;fi&rsquo; would
submit on condition of receiving a free pardon was not fulfilled,
and he resolved to set out himself to Khorasan, taking with him
his second son Mamun. On the journey he was attacked by an
internal malady, which carried him off, ten months after his
departure from Bagdad, <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 193 (March 809), just on his arrival
at the city of T&#363;s. H&#257;r&#363;n was only forty-five years of age. He
was far from having the high qualifications of his grandfather
Mansur; indeed he did not even possess the qualities of his
father and his brother. When the latter asked him to renounce
his right of succession, he was willing to consent, saying that
a quiet life with his beloved wife, the princess Zobaida, was
his highest wish, but he obeyed his mother and Yahy&#257; b. Kh&#257;lid.
As long as the Barmecides were in office, he acted only on
their direction. After their disgrace he was led into many
impolitic actions by his violent and often cruel propensities.
But the empire was, especially in the earlier part of his reign,
in a very prosperous state, and was respected widely by foreign
powers. Embassies passed between Charlemagne and H&#257;r&#363;n
in the years 180 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 797) and 184 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 801), by which the
former obtained facilities for the pilgrims to the Holy Land, the
latter probably concessions for the trade on the Mediterranean
ports. The ambassadors brought presents with them; on one
of these occasions the first elephant reached the land of the
Franks.</p>

<p>Under the reign of H&#257;r&#363;n, Ibr&#257;h&#299;m b. al-Aghlab, the governor
of Africa, succeeded in making himself independent of the central
government, on condition of paying a fixed annual tribute to his
suzerain the caliph. This was, if we do not take Spain into the
account, the first instance of dismemberment, later to be followed
by many others.</p>

<p>In the days of this caliph the first paper factories were founded
in Bagdad.</p>

<p>6. <i>Reign of Am&#299;n</i>.&mdash;On the death of H&#257;r&#363;n his minister,
Fadl b. Rab&#299;&rsquo;, with the view of gaining the new caliph&rsquo;s confidence,
hastened to call together all the troops of the late caliph
and to lead them back to Bagdad, in order to place them in the
hands of the new sovereign, Am&#299;n. He even, in direct violation
of H&#257;r&#363;n&rsquo;s will, led back the corps which was intended to occupy
Khorasan under the authority of Mamun. Aware, however,
that in thus acting he was making Mamun his irreconcilable
enemy, he persuaded Am&#299;n to exclude Mamun from the succession.
Mamun, on receiving his brother&rsquo;s invitation to go to
Bagdad, was greatly perplexed; but his tutor and later vizier,
Fadl b. Sahl, a Zoroastrian of great influence, who in 806 had
adopted Islam, reanimated his courage, and pointed out to him
that certain death awaited him at Bagdad. Mamun resolved
to hold out, and found pretexts for remaining in Khorasan.
Am&#299;n, in anger, caused the will of his father, which, as we have
seen, was preserved in the Ka&lsquo;ba, to be destroyed, declared on
his own authority that Mamun&rsquo;s rights of succession were
forfeited, and caused the army to swear allegiance to his own son
M&#363;s&#257;, a child of five, on whom he bestowed the title of <i>an-N&#257;tiq
bil-Haqq</i> (&ldquo;he who speaks according to truth&rdquo;), <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 194 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>
809-810). On hearing the news, Mamun, strong in the rightfulness
of his claim, retaliated by suppressing the caliph&rsquo;s name in
all public acts. Am&#299;n immediately despatched to Khorasan an
army of 40,000 under the command of Ali b. &lsquo;&#298;s&#257;, who had regained
his former influence, and told the caliph that, at his
coming to Khorasan, all the leading men would come over to his
side. Zobaida, the mother of the caliph, entreated Ali to treat
Mamun kindly when he should have made him captive. It is
said that Fadl b. Sahl had, through a secret agent, induced
Fadl b. Rab&#299;&rsquo; to select Ali, knowing that the dislike felt towards
him by the Khorasanians would double their strength in fighting
against him. Mamun, on his side, sent in all haste an army of
less than 4000 men of his faithful Khorasanians, and entrusted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>
their command to &#7788;&#257;hir b. Hosain, who displayed remarkable
abilities in the war that ensued. The two armies met under the
walls of Rai (Shaaban 195, May 811). By a bold attack, in the
manner of the Kharijites of yore, &#7788;&#257;hir penetrated into the centre
of the hostile army and killed Ali. The frightened army fled,
leaving the camp with all its treasures to &#7788;&#257;hir, who from that
day was named &ldquo;the man with the two right hands.&rdquo; A
courier was despatched immediately to Merv, who performed the
journey, a distance of about 750 miles, in three days. On
the very day of his arrival, Harthama b. A&lsquo;yan had left Merv
with reinforcements. Mamun now no longer hesitated to take
the title of caliph.</p>

<p>When the news of Ali&rsquo;s defeat came to Bagdad, Am&#299;n sent
Abdarrahm&#257;n b. Jabala to Hamad&#257;n with 20,000 men. &#7788;&#257;hir
defeated him, forced Hamad&#257;n to surrender, and occupied all
the strong places in Jabal (Media). The year after, Am&#299;n placed
in the field two new armies commanded respectively by Ahmad
b. Mazyad and Abdallah b. &#7716;omaid b. Qa&#7717;&#7789;aba. The skilful
&#7788;&#257;hir succeeded in creating divisions among the troops of his
adversaries, and obtained possession, without striking a blow,
of the city of Holw&#257;n, an advantage which opened the way to
the very gates of Bagdad. He was here reinforced by troops
sent from Khorasan under the command of Harthama b. A&lsquo;yan,
who was appointed leader of the war against Am&#299;n, with orders
to send &#7788;&#257;hir to Ahw&#257;z. &#7788;&#257;hir continued his victorious march,
conquered Ahw&#257;z, took W&#257;sit and Mad&#257;in, and pitched his camp
near one of the gates of the capital, where he was rejoined by
Harthama. One after the other the provinces fell away from
Am&#299;n, and he soon found himself in possession of Bagdad alone.
The city, though blockaded on every side, made a desperate
defence for nearly two years. Ultimately the eastern part of
the city fell into the hands of &#7788;&#257;hir, and Am&#299;n, deserted by his
followers, was compelled to surrender. He resolved to treat with
Harthama, as he was averse to &#7788;&#257;hir; but this step caused his
ruin. &#7788;&#257;hir succeeded in intercepting him on his way to Harthama,
and immediately ordered him to be put to death. His
head was sent to Mamun (September 813). It was presented to
him by his vizier, Fa&#7693;l b. Sahl, surnamed Dhu&lsquo;l-Riy&#257;satain, or
&ldquo;the man with two governments,&rdquo; because his master had
committed to him both the ministry of war and the general
administration. Mamun hid his joy beneath a feigned display of
sorrow.</p>

<p>Am&#299;n was only twenty-eight years old. As a ruler he was
wholly incompetent. He hardly comprehended the importance
of the affairs with which he was called upon to deal. He acted
invariably on the advice of those who for the time had his
confidence, and occupied himself mainly with the affairs of his
harem, with polo, fishing, wine and music. The five years of his
reign were disastrous to the empire, and in particular to Bagdad
which never entirely recovered its old splendour.</p>

<p>7. <i>Reign of Mamun.</i>&mdash;On the day following the death of
Am&#299;n &#7788;&#257;hir caused Mamun to be proclaimed at Bagdad, and
promised in his name a general amnesty. The accession of this
prince appeared likely to restore to the empire the order necessary
for its prosperity. It was not so, however. The reign of Mamun&mdash;that
reign in which art, science and letters, under the patronage
of the caliph, threw so brilliant a lustre&mdash;had a very stormy
beginning. Mamun was in no haste to remove to Bagdad, but
continued to reside at Merv. In his gratitude to Fa&#7693;l b. Sahl,
to whose service he owed his success, he not only chose him as
prime minister of the empire, but also named his brother, Hasan
b. Sahl, governor of Media, F&#257;rs, Ahw&#257;z, Arabia and Irak. The
two generals to whom he owed still more were not treated as
they deserved. Harthama was ordered to return to Khorasan;
&#7788;&#257;hir was made governor of Mesopotamia and Syria, with the
task of subduing Na&#7779;r b. Shabath, who with numerous adherents
refused submission to the caliph. The Alids seized on the elevation
of Mamun as a pretext for fresh revolts. At Kufa a certain
Ibn &#7788;ab&#257;&#7789;ab&#257; placed an army in the field under Abu&lsquo;l-Sar&#257;y&#257;,
who had been a captain in the army of Harthama. An army
sent by Hasan b. Sahl was defeated, and Abu&lsquo;l-Sar&#257;y&#257;, no longer
content to play a second part, poisoned his chief, Ibn &#7788;ab&#257;&#7789;ab&#257;,
and put in his place another of the family of Ali, Mahommed
b. Mahommed, whom, on account of his extreme youth, he
hoped to govern at his will. Abu&lsquo;l-Sar&#257;y&#257;&rsquo;s success continued,
and several cities of Irak&mdash;Basra, W&#257;sit and Mad&#257;in&mdash;fell into
his hands. Mecca, Medina and Yemen also were mastered by
the Alids, who committed all kinds of atrocities and sacrilege.
Abu&lsquo;l-Sar&#257;y&#257;, who even struck money in Kufa, began to menace
the capital, when Hasan b. Sahl hastily sent a messenger to
Harthama b. A&lsquo;yan, who was already at Holw&#257;n on his way back
to Merv, entreating him to come to his aid. Harthama, who
was deeply offended by his dismissal, refused at first, but at last
consented, and at once checked the tide of disaster. The troops
of the Alids were everywhere driven back, and the whole of Irak
fell again into the hands of the Abbasids. Kufa opened its
gates; Basra was taken by assault. Abu&lsquo;l-Sar&#257;y&#257; and
Mahommed b. Mahommed fled to Mesopotamia, but were made
prisoners. The former was decapitated, the latter was sent to
Khorasan, the revolt in Arabia was quickly suppressed, and
peace seemed within reach. This, however, was by no means
the case. The disorder of civil war had caused a multitude of
robbers and vagabonds to emerge from the purlieus of Bagdad.
These ruffians proceeded to treat the capital as a conquered city,
and it became necessary for all good citizens to organize themselves
into a regular militia. Harthama, having vanquished
Abu&lsquo;l-Sar&#257;y&#257;, did not go to Hasan b. Sahl, but proceeded
towards Merv with the purpose of telling Mamun that the state
of affairs was not as Fadl b. Sahl represented it to him, and
urging him to come to Bagdad, where his presence was necessary.
Fadl, informed of his intentions, filled the caliph&rsquo;s mind with
distrust against the old general, so that when Harthama arrived
Mamun had him cast into prison, where he died shortly afterwards.
When the tidings of his disgrace came to Bagdad, the
people expelled the lieutenant of Hasan b. Sahl, called by them
the M&#257;j&#363;z&#299; (&ldquo;the Zoroastrian&rdquo;), who had chosen Mad&#257;in for his
residence, and put at their head Mans&#363;r, a son of Mahdi, who
refused to assume the title of caliph, but consented to be Mamun&rsquo;s
vicegerent instead of Hasan b. Sahl.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at Merv, Mamun was adopting a decision which
fell like a thunderbolt on the Abbasids. In <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 201 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 817),
under pretence of putting an end to the continual revolts of the
partisans of Ali, and acting on the advice of his prime minister
Fadl, he publicly designated as his successor in the Caliphate Ali
ar-Rid&#257;, a son of that M&#363;s&#257; al-K&#257;zim who perished in the prison
of Mahdi, a direct descendant of Hosain, the son of Ali, and
proscribed black, the colour of the Abbasids, in favour of that of
the house of Ali, green. This step was well calculated to delight
the followers of Ali, but it could not fail to exasperate the
Abbasids and their partisans. The people of Bagdad refused to
take the oath to Ali b. M&#363;s&#257;, declared Mamun deposed, and
elected his uncle, Ibr&#257;h&#299;m, son of Mahdi, to the Caliphate.<a name="fa33b" id="fa33b" href="#ft33b"><span class="sp">33</span></a> It
was only indirectly that the news reached the caliph, who then
saw that Fadl had been treating him as a puppet. His anger
was great, but he kept it carefully to himself. Fadl was one day
found murdered, and Ali b. M&#363;s&#257; died suddenly. The historians
bring no open accusation against Mamun, but it seems clear
that the opportune removal of these men was not due to chance.
Mamun affected the profoundest grief, and, in order to disarm
suspicion, appointed as his prime minister the brother of Fadl,
Hasan b. Sahl, whose daughter B&#363;r&#257;n he afterwards married.
Soon after the news came to him that Hasan b. Sahl had become
insane. Mamun appointed an officer to act as his lieutenant,
and wrote that he was coming to Bagdad in a short time. From
that moment the pseudo-caliph Ibr&#257;h&#299;m found himself deserted,
and was obliged to seek safety in concealment. His precarious
reign had, however, lasted nearly two years. Mamun had found
out also that the general uneasiness was largely due to his treatment
of Harthama and T&#257;hir, the latter having been put in a
rebellious country without the men and the money to maintain
his authority. The caliph therefore wrote to T&#257;hir to meet him
at Nahraw&#257;n, where he was received with the greatest honour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>
Having taken all precautions, Mamun now made his solemn
entry into Bagdad, but, to show that he came as a master, he
still displayed for several days the green colours, though at last,
at the request of T&#257;hir, he consented to resume the black. From
this time, <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 204 (August 819), the real reign of Mamun began,
freed as he now was from the tutelage of Fa&#7693;l.</p>

<p>When welcoming T&#257;hir, Mamun bade him ask for any reward
he might desire. T&#257;hir, fearing lest the caliph, not being able to
endure the sight of the murderer of his brother, should change
his mind towards him, contrived to get himself appointed
governor of Khorasan. Like most of the great Moslem generals,
T&#257;hir, it is said, had conceived the project of creating an independent
kingdom for himself. His death, <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 207 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 822),
prevented its realization; but as his descendants succeeded him
one after the other in the post of governor, he may be said in
reality to have founded a dynasty in Khorasan. His son Abdallah
b. T&#257;hir was a special favourite of Mamun, He brought Na&#7779;r b.
Shabath to subjection in Mesopotamia, and overcame by great
ability a very dangerous rebellion in Egypt. When he returned
thence, the caliph gave him the choice between the government
of Khorasan and that of the northern provinces, where he would
have to combat Babak the Khorramite. Abdallah chose the
former (see below, ¬ß 8).</p>

<p>The pseudo-caliph, Ibr&#257;him, who, since Mamun&rsquo;s entry into
Bagdad, had led a wandering life, was eventually arrested. But
Mamun generously pardoned him, as well as Fa&#7693;l b. Rabi&rsquo;, the
chief promoter of the terrible civil war which had so lately
shaken the empire. After that time, Ibrahim lived peacefully
at the court, cultivating the arts of singing and music.</p>

<p>Tranquillity being now everywhere re-established, Mamun
gave himself up to science and literature. He caused works on
mathematics, astronomy, medicine and philosophy to be translated
from the Greek, and founded in Bagdad a kind of academy,
called the &ldquo;House of Science,&rdquo; with a library and an observatory.
It was also by his orders that two learned mathematicians
undertook the measurement of a degree of the earth&rsquo;s circumference.
Mamun interested himself too in questions of religious
dogma. He had embraced the Motazilite doctrine about free will
and predestination, and was in particular shocked at the opinion
which had spread among the Moslem doctors that the Koran
was the uncreated word of God. In the year 212 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 827) he
published an edict by which the Motazilite (Mu&rsquo;tazilite) doctrine
was declared to be the religion of the state, the orthodox faith
condemned as heretical. At the same time he ordered all his
subjects to honour Ali as the best creature of God after the
Prophet, and forbade the praise of Moawiya. In <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 218 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>
833) a new edict appeared by which all judges and doctors
were summoned to renounce the error of the uncreated word of
God. Several distinguished doctors, and, among others, the
celebrated Ahmad b. &#7716;anbal (<i>q.v.</i>), founder of one of the four
orthodox Moslem schools, were obliged to appear before an
inquisitorial tribunal; and as they persisted in their belief
respecting the Koran, they were thrown into prison. Mamun,
being at Tarsus, received from the governor of Bagdad the report
of the tribunal, and ordered that the culprits should be sent off
to him. Happily for these unfortunate doctors, they had
scarcely reached Adana, when news of the caliph&rsquo;s death
arrived and they were brought back to Bagdad. The two
successors of Mamun maintained the edicts&mdash;Ahmad b. &#7716;anbal,
who obstinately refused to yield, was flogged in the year 834&mdash;
but it seems that Motasim did not himself take much interest in
the question, which perhaps he hardly understood, and that the
prosecution of the inquisition by him was due in great part to
the charge which was left him in Mamun&rsquo;s will. In the reign of
Motawakkil the orthodox faith was restored, never to be assailed
again.<a name="fa34b" id="fa34b" href="#ft34b"><span class="sp">34</span></a></p>

<p>In spite of these manifold activities Mamun did not forget the
hereditary enemy of Islam. In the years 830, 831 and 832 he
made expeditions into Asia Minor with such success that Theophilus,
the Greek emperor, sued for peace, which Mamun
haughtily refused to grant. Accordingly, he decided on marching
in the following year against Amorium, and thence to Constantinople
itself. Having sent before him his son Abbas to make
Tyana a strong fortress, he set out for Asia Minor to put himself
at the head of the army, but died of a fever brought on by
bathing in the chill river, Pedendon, 40 m. from Tarsus, in Rajab
218 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> August 833), at the age of forty-eight.</p>

<p>Mamun was a man of rare qualities, and one of the best rulers
of the whole dynasty after Mansur. By him the ascendancy of
the Persian element over the Arabian was completed. Moreover,
he began to attract young Turkish noblemen to his court, an
example which was followed on a much larger scale by his
successor and led to the supremacy of the Turks at a later period.</p>

<p>8. <i>Reign of Motasim.</i>&mdash;Abu Is&#7717;&#257;k al-Mo&rsquo;ta&#7779;im had for a
long time been preparing himself for the succession. Every year he
had bought Turkish slaves, and had with him in the last expedition
of Mamun a bodyguard of 3000. Backed by this force he
seems to have persuaded the ailing caliph to designate him as his
successor. The chroniclers content themselves with recording
that he himself wrote in the name of the caliph to the chief
authorities in Bagdad and elsewhere that he was to be the
successor. His accession, however, met at first with active
opposition in the army, where a powerful party demanded
that Abbas should take the place of his father. Abbas, however,
publicly renounced all pretension to the Caliphate, and the whole
army accepted Motasim, who immediately had the fortifications
of Tyana demolished and hastened back to Bagdad, where he
made his public entry on the 20th of September 833.</p>

<p>Motasim wanted officers for his bodyguard. Immediately
after his coming to Bagdad, he bought all the Turkish slaves
living there who had distinguished themselves. Among them
were Ashn&#257;s, It&#257;kh, Was&#299;f, S&#299;m&#257;, all of whom later became
men of great influence. The guard was composed of an undisciplined
body of soldiers, who, moreover, held in open contempt the
religious precepts of Islam. Tired of the excesses committed
by these Turks, the people of Bagdad beat or killed as many of
them as they could lay hands on, and Motasim, not daring to
act with severity against either his guard or the citizens, took the
course of quitting the city. Having bought in 834 territories at
S&#257;marr&#257;, a small place situated a few leagues above Bagdad,
he caused a new residence to be built there, whose name, which
could be interpreted &ldquo;Unhappy is he who sees it,&rdquo; was changed
by him into Sorra-man-ra&lsquo;&#257;, &ldquo;Rejoiced is he who sees it.&rdquo;
Leaving the government of the capital in the hands of his son
H&#257;r&#363;n al-W&#257;thiq, he established himself at S&#257;marr&#257; in 836.
This resolution of Motasim was destined to prove fatal to his
dynasty; for it placed the caliphs at the mercy of their praetorians.
In fact, from the time of W&#257;thiq, the Caliphate became
the plaything of the Turkish guard, and its decline was continuous.</p>

<p>In the time of the civil war the marshlands in Irak between
Basra and W&#257;sit had been occupied by a large population of
Indians, called <i>yat</i>, or, according to the Arabic pronunciation,
<i>Zo&#7789;&#7789;</i>, who infested the roads and levied a heavy tribute from the
ships ascending and descending the Tigris. From the year 821
onwards Mamun had tried in vain to bring them to submission.
When Motasim came back to Bagdad, after the death of his
brother, he found the people in great distress, their supply of
dates from Basra having been cut off by the Zo&#7789;&#7789;, and resolved
to put them down with all means. After seven months of
vigorous resistance, they at last yielded on condition of safety
of life and property. In January 835 the Zo&#7789;&#7789; in their national
costume and with their own music were conducted on a great
number of boats through Bagdad. Thence they were transported
to Ainzarba (Anazarba) on the frontier of the Greek empire.
Twenty years later they entered Asia Minor, whence in a later
period they came into Europe, under the name of Athinganoi
(Ziganes) and Egyptians (gipsies).<a name="fa35b" id="fa35b" href="#ft35b"><span class="sp">35</span></a></p>

<p>A far more difficult task lay before Motasim, the subjection of
B&#257;bak al-Khorram&#299; in Azerbaijan. Though the name Khorram&#299;
is often employed by the Moslem writers to designate such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span>
extravagant Moslem sectaries as the H&#257;shim&#299;ya, the real Khorram&#299;
were not Moslems, but Persian Mazdaqites, or communists.
The name Khorram&#299;, or Khorramd&#299;n&#299;, &ldquo;adherent of the pleasant
religion,&rdquo; seems to be a nickname. As they bore red colours,
they were also called Mohammira, or Redmakers. Their object
was to abolish Islam and to restore &ldquo;the white religion.&rdquo; We
find the first mention of them in the year 808, when Harun
al-Rashid sent an army against them. During the civil war
their power was steadily increasing, and spread not only over
Azerbaijan, but also over Media (Jabal) and Khorasan. The
numerous efforts of Mamun to put them down had been all in
vain, and they were now in alliance with the Byzantine emperor.
Therefore, in the year 835, Motasim made Afsh&#299;n, a Turkish
prince who had distinguished himself already in the days of
Mamun, governor of Media, with orders to take the lead of the
war against B&#257;bak. After three years&rsquo; fighting, B&#257;bak was
taken prisoner. He was carried to S&#257;marr&#257;, led through the city
on the back of an elephant, and then delivered to the executioners,
who cut off his arms and legs. His head was sent to
Khorasan, his body was crucified. For long afterwards the place
where this happened bore the name of &ldquo;B&#257;bak&rsquo;s Cross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the hope of creating a diversion in B&#257;bak&rsquo;s favour, Theophilus
in 837 fell upon and laid waste the frontier town of
Zibatra. There and in several other places he took a great
number of prisoners, whom he mutilated. The news arrived just
after that of the capture of B&#257;bak, and Motasim swore to take
exemplary vengeance. He assembled a formidable army,
penetrated into Asia Minor, and took the city of Amorium,
where he gained rich plunder. During his return the caliph
was informed of a conspiracy in the army in favour of &lsquo;Abb&#257;s
the son of Mamun, of which &lsquo;Ojaif b. &lsquo;Anbasa was the ringleader.
The unfortunate prince was arrested and died soon after in prison.
The conspirators were killed, many of them with great cruelty.
(For the campaign see Bury in <i>J.H.S.</i>, 1909, xxix. pt. i.)</p>

<p>Motasim had just returned to S&#257;marr&#257; when a serious revolt
broke out in Tabaristan, M&#257;ziy&#257;r, one of the hereditary chiefs
of that country, refusing to acknowledge the authority of Abdallah
Ibn &#7788;&#257;hir, the governor of Khorasan, of which Tabaristan was
a province. The revolt was suppressed with great difficulty,
and it came out that it was due to the secret instigation of
Afsh&#299;n, who hoped thereby to cause the fall of the &#7788;&#257;hirids,
and to take their place, with the ulterior object of founding an
independent kingdom in the East. Afsh&#299;n, who stood at that
moment in the highest favour of the caliph, was condemned
and died in prison. Motasim died a year later, January 842.</p>

<p>9. <i>Reign of W&#257;thiq.</i>&mdash;His son W&#257;thiq, who succeeded, though
not in the least to be compared with Mamun, had yet in common
with him a thirst for knowledge&mdash;perhaps curiosity would be a
more appropriate term&mdash;which prompted him, as soon as he
became caliph, to send the famous astronomer Mahommed b.
M&#363;s&#257; into Asia Minor to find out all about the Seven Sleepers
which he discovered in the neighbourhood of Arabissus,<a name="fa36b" id="fa36b" href="#ft36b"><span class="sp">36</span></a> and
Sall&#257;m the Interpreter to explore the situation of the famous
wall of Gog and Magog, which he reached at the north-west
frontier of China.<a name="fa37b" id="fa37b" href="#ft37b"><span class="sp">37</span></a> For these and other personal pursuits he
raised money by forcing a number of high functionaries to
disgorge their gains. In so vast an empire the governors and
administrators had necessarily enjoyed an almost unrestricted
power, and this had enabled them to accumulate wealth. Omar
had already compelled them to furnish an account of their riches,
and, when he found that they had abused their trust, to relinquish
half to the state. As time went on, nomination to an office
was more and more generally considered a step to wealth.
During the reign of the Omayyads a few large fortunes were
made thus. But with the increasing luxury after Mansur, the
thirst for money became universal, and the number of honest
officials lessened fast. Confiscation of property had been
employed with success by H&#257;r&#363;n al-Rash&#299;d after the disgrace of
the Barmecides, and occasionally by his successors, but W&#257;thiq
was the first to imprison high officials and fine them heavily on
the specific charge of peculation.</p>

<p>The caliph also shared Mamun&rsquo;s intolerance on the doctrinal
question of the uncreated Koran. He carried his zeal to such a
point that, on the occasion of an exchange of Greek against
Moslem prisoners in 845, he refused to receive those Moslem
captives who would not declare their belief that the Koran was
created. The orthodox in Bagdad prepared to revolt, but were
discovered in time by the governor of the city. The ringleader
Ahmad b. Na&#7779;r al-Khoz&#257;&lsquo;&#299; was seized and brought to S&#257;marr&#257;,
where W&#257;thiq beheaded him in person. The only other event
of importance in the reign of W&#257;thiq was a rising of the Arabian
tribes in the environs of Medina, which the Turkish general
Bogh&#257; with difficulty repressed. When he reached S&#257;marr&#257; with
his prisoners, W&#257;thiq had just died (August 846). That the
predominance of the praetorians was already established is clear
from the fact that W&#257;thiq gave to two Turkish generals, Ashn&#257;s
and It&#257;kh respectively, the titular but lucrative supreme government
of all the western and all the eastern provinces. In his days
the soldiery at S&#257;marr&#257; was increased by a large division of
Africans (Maghrib&#299;s).</p>

<p>10. <i>Reign of Motawakkil.</i>&mdash;As W&#257;thiq had appointed no
successor the vizier Mahommed Zayy&#257;t had cast his eye on
his son Mahommed, who was still a child, but the generals Was&#299;f
and It&#257;kh, seconded by the upper cadi Ibn ab&#299; Da&rsquo;ud, refused
their consent, and offered the supreme power to W&#257;thiq&rsquo;s
brother Ja&lsquo;far, who at his installation adopted the name of
<i>al-Motawakkil &lsquo;al&#257; &lsquo;ll&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who trusts in God&rdquo;). The new
caliph hated the vizier Zayy&#257;t, who had opposed his election, and
had him seized and killed with the same atrocious cruelty which
the vizier himself had inflicted on others. His possessions, and
those of others who had opposed the caliph&rsquo;s election, were
confiscated. But the arrogance of It&#257;kh, to whom he owed his
Caliphate, became insufferable. So, with the perfidy of his race,
the caliph took him off his guard, and had him imprisoned and
killed at Bagdad. He was succeeded by Was&#299;f.</p>

<p>About this time an impostor named Mahm&#363;d b. Faraj had set
himself up as a prophet, claiming to be Dhu&lsquo;l-Qarnain (Alexander
the Great) risen from the dead. Asserting that Gabriel brought
him revelations, he had contrived to attract twenty-seven
followers. The caliph had him flogged, and compelled each of
the twenty-seven to give him ten blows on the head with his
fist. The &ldquo;prophet&rdquo; expired under the blows (850).</p>

<p>One of the first acts of Motawakkil was the release of all those
who had been imprisoned for refusing to admit the dogma of the
created Koran, and the strict order to abstain from any litigation
about the Book of God. The upper cadi Ibn ab&#299; Da&rsquo;ud, the
leader of the movement against orthodoxy, who had stood in
great esteem with Mamun and had fulfilled his high office under
the reigns of Motasim and W&#257;thiq, had a stroke of paralysis in
the year 848. His son Mahommed was put in his place till 851,
when all the members of the family were arrested. They released
themselves by paying the enormous sum of 240,000 din&#257;rs and
16,000,000 dirhems, which constituted nearly their whole
fortune, and were then sent to Bagdad, where father and son
died three years later. An orthodox upper cadi was named
instead, and the dogma of the created Koran was declared
heresy; therewith began a persecution of all the adherents of
that doctrine and other Motazilite tenets. Orthodoxy triumphed,
never again to lose its place as the state religion. Hand in hand
with these reactionary measures came two others, one against
Jews and Christians, one against the Shi&lsquo;ites. The first caliph
who imposed humiliating conditions on the Dhimmis, or Covenanters,
who, on condition of paying a certain not over-heavy
tribute, enjoyed the protection of the state and the free exercise
of their cult, was Omar II., but this policy was not continued.
A proposition by the cadi Ab&#363; Y&#363;suf to H&#257;r&#363;n al-Rashid to
renew it had not been adopted. Motawakkil, in 850, formulated
an edict by which these sectaries were compelled to wear a
distinctive dress and to distinguish their houses by a figure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span>
the devil nailed to the door, excluding them at the same time
from all public employments, and forbidding them to send their
children to Moslem schools. Nevertheless, he kept his Christian
medical men, some of whom were high in favour. He showed
his hatred for the Shi&lsquo;ites by causing the mausoleum erected over
the tomb of Hosain at Kerbela, together with all the buildings
surrounding it, to be levelled to the ground and the site to be
ploughed up, and by forbidding any one to visit the spot. A year
before, a descendant of Hosain, Yahy&#257; b. Omar, had been arrested
and flogged on his orders. He escaped afterwards, rose in
rebellion at Kufa in 864, and was killed in battle. It is reported
that the caliph even permitted one of his buffoons to turn the
person of Ali into mockery.</p>

<p>In the year 848-849 Ibn Ba&lsquo;&#299;th, who had rendered good service
in the war against B&#257;bak, but had for some cause been arrested,
fled from S&#257;marr&#257; to Marand in Azerbaijan and revolted. Not
without great difficulty Bogh&#257;, the Turkish general, succeeded
in taking the town and making Ibn Ba&lsquo;&#299;th prisoner. He was
brought before Motawakkil and died in prison. In the year 237
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 851-852) a revolt broke out in Armenia. Notwithstanding
a vigorous resistance, Bogh&#257; subdued and pacified the province
in the following year. In that same year, 852-853, the Byzantines
made a descent on Egypt with 300 vessels. &lsquo;Anbasa the
governor had ordered the garrison of Damietta to parade at the
capital Fost&#257;t. The denuded town was taken, plundered and
burned. The Greeks then destroyed all the fortifications at the
mouth of the Nile near Tinnis, and returned with prisoners and
booty. The annual raids of Moslems and Greeks in the border
districts of Asia Minor were attended with alternate successes,
though on the whole the Greeks had the upper hand. In 856
they penetrated as far as Amid (Di&#257;rbekr), and returned with
10,000 prisoners. But in the year 859 the Greeks suffered a
heavy defeat with losses of men and cattle, the emperor Michael
himself was in danger, whilst the fleet of the Moslems captured
and sacked Antalia. This was followed by a truce and an
exchange of prisoners in the following year.</p>

<p>In 855 a revolt broke out in Homs (Emesa), where the harsh
conditions imposed by the caliph on the Christians and Jews
had caused great discontent. It was repressed after a vigorous
resistance. A great many leading men were flogged to death,
all churches and synagogues were destroyed and all the Christians
banished.</p>

<p>In the year 851 the Boja (or Beja), a wild people living between
the Red Sea and the Nile of Upper Egypt, the Blemmyes of the
ancients, refused to pay the annual tribute, and invaded the
land of the gold and emerald mines, so that the working of the
mines was stopped. The caliph sent against them Mahommed
al-Qomm&#299;, who subdued them in 856 and brought their king
Ali B&#257;b&#257; to S&#257;marr&#257; before Motawakkil, on condition that he
should be restored to his kingdom.</p>

<p>About this time Sijistan liberated itself from the supremacy
of the &#7788;&#257;hirids. Ya&rsquo;q&#363;b b. Laith al-Saff&#257;r proclaimed himself
am&#299;r of that province in the year 860, and was soon after confirmed
in this dignity by the caliph.</p>

<p>In 858 Motawakkil, hoping to escape from the arrogant
patronage of Wa&#7779;&#299;f, who had taken the place of It&#257;kh as head
of the Turkish guard, transferred his residence to Damascus.
But the place did not agree with him, and he returned to S&#257;marr&#257;,
where he caused a magnificent quarter to be built 3 m. from the
city, which he called after his own name Ja&lsquo;far&#299;ya, and on which
he spent more than two millions of dinars (about ¬£900,000).
He found the means by following the example of his predecessor
in depriving many officials of their ill-gotten gains. He contrived
to enrol in his service nearly 12,000 men, for the greater part
Arabs, in order to crush the Turks. In the year of his elevation
to the Caliphate, he had regulated the succession to the empire
in his own family by designating as future caliphs his three sons,
<i>al-Monta&#7779;ir bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who seeks help in God&rdquo;), <i>al-Mo&rsquo;tazz
bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he whose strength is of God&rdquo;), and <i>al-Mowayyad bill&#257;h</i>
(&ldquo;he who is assisted by God&rdquo;). By and by he conceived an
aversion to his eldest son, and wished to supplant him by Motazz,
the son of his favourite wife Qab&#299;ha. The day had been fixed on
which Montasir, Wa&#7779;&#299;f and several other Turkish generals were
to be assassinated. But Wa&#7779;&#299;f and Montasir had been informed,
and resolved to anticipate him. In the night before, Shaww&#257;l
<span class="sc">a.h.</span> 247 (December 861), Motawakkil, after one of his wonted
orgies, was murdered, together with his confidant, Fat&#7717; b. Kh&#257;q&#257;n.
The official report, promulgated by his successor, was that Fat&#7717;
b. Kh&#257;q&#257;n had murdered his master and had been punished for
it by death. For the administrative system in this reign see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan Institutions</a></span>.</p>

<p>11. <i>Reign of Montasir.</i>&mdash;On the very night of his father&rsquo;s
assassination Montasir had himself proclaimed caliph. He was
a man of very feeble character, and a mere puppet in the hands
of his vizier Ahmad b. Kha&#7779;&#299;b and the Turkish generals. He
was compelled to send Wasif, the personal enemy of Ibn Kha&#7779;&#299;b,
to the frontier for a term of four years, and then to deprive his
two brothers Motazz and Mowayyad, who were not agreeable to
them, of their right of succession. He died six months after, by
poison, it is said.</p>

<p>12. <i>Reign of Mosta&lsquo;&#299;n.</i>&mdash;The Turkish soldiery, now the chief
power in the state, chose, by the advice of Ibn Kha&#7779;&#299;b, in succession
to Montasir, his cousin Ahmad, who took the  title of
<i>al-Mosta&lsquo;&#299;n bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who looks for help to God&rdquo;). In the
reign of this feeble prince the Greeks inflicted serious losses on
the Moslems in Asia Minor. A great many volunteers from all
parts, who offered their services, were hunted down as rioters
by the Turkish generals, who were wholly absorbed by their
own interests. The party which had placed Mosta&lsquo;&#299;n on the
throne, led by Ibn Kha&#7779;&#299;b and Ot&#257;mish, were soon overpowered
by Wa&#7779;&#299;f and Bogh&#257;. Ibn Kha&#7779;&#299;b was banished to Crete,
Ot&#257;mish murdered. The superior party, however, maintained
Mosta&lsquo;&#299;n on the throne, because they feared lest Motazz should
take vengeance upon them for the murder of his father Motawakkil.
But in the year 865 Wa&#7779;&#299;f and Bogh&#257; fled with Mosta&lsquo;&#299;n
to Bagdad, and Motazz was proclaimed caliph at S&#257;marr&#257;. A
terrible war ensued; Mosta&lsquo;&#299;n was obliged to abdicate, and was
killed in the following year.</p>

<p>In 864 a descendant of Ali, named Hasan b. Zaid, gained
possession of Tabaristan and occupied the great city of Rai
(Rey) near Teheran. A year later the province was reconquered
by the &#7788;&#257;hirid governor of Khorasan, so that Hasan was obliged
to retreat for refuge to the land of the Dailam. But he returned
soon, and after many reverses ruled over Tabaristan and Jorj&#257;n
for many years.</p>

<p>13. <i>Reign of Motazz.</i>&mdash;Motazz, proclaimed caliph at Bagdad
in the first month of 252 (January 866), devoted himself to the
object of freeing himself from the omnipotent Turkish generals,
especially Wa&#7779;&#299;f and Bogh&#257;, who had opposed his election. But
such a task demanded an ability and energy which he did not
possess. He was obliged to grant them amnesty and to recall
them to S&#257;marr&#257;. He mistrusted also his brothers Mowayyad
and Mowaffaq, who had interceded for them. He put the former
to death and drove the latter into exile to Bagdad. Some time
after he had the satisfaction of seeing Wa&#7779;&#299;f killed by his own
troops, and succeeded, a year later, in having Bogh&#257; assassinated.
But a more difficult problem was the payment of the Turkish,
Persian and African guards, which was said to have amounted
in <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 252 to 200,000,000 dirhems<a name="fa38b" id="fa38b" href="#ft38b"><span class="sp">38</span></a> (about ¬£6,500,000), or
apparently twice the revenue derived from the land tax. As the
provincial revenues annually decreased, it became impossible
to pay this sum, and &#7778;&#257;li&#7717; the son of  Wa&#7779;&#299;f, in spite of the
remonstrances of the caliph, confiscated the property of state
officials. Upon a further demand, Motazz, having failed to
procure money from his mother Qab&#299;ha, who was enormously
rich, was seized upon and tortured, and died of starvation in
prison (Shaaban 255, July 868).</p>

<p>The dismemberment of the empire continued fast in these
years, and the caliph was compelled to recognize the virtual
independence of the governors Ya&rsquo;q&#363;b the Saff&#257;rid (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Saff&#257;rids</a></span>
and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Persia</a></span>, <i>History</i>, ¬ß B) in Seistan, and Ahmad
b. T&#363;l&#363;n in Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span></p>

<p>14. <i>Reign  of Mohtad&#299;.</i>&mdash;Immediately after the seizure of
Motazz, the Turks, led by &#7778;&#257;li&#7717; b. Wa&#7779;&#299;f, proclaimed as caliph
one of the sons of W&#257;thiq with the title of al-Mohtad&#299; bill&#257;h
(&ldquo;the guided by God&rdquo;), who, however, refused to occupy the
throne until his predecessor had solemnly abdicated. Mohtad&#299;,
who was a man of noble and generous spirit and had no lack of
energy, began by applying the precarious measure of power
which was left him to the reform of the court. He banished the
musicians and singers, and forbade all kinds of games; he
devoted himself to the administration of justice, and gave
public audiences to the people for the redress of their grievances.
At the same time he contrived to elevate the power of the Abn&#257;,
the descendants of those Persian soldiers who had established
the dynasty of the Abbasids, in order to break the supremacy
of the Turks and other mercenaries. But Mohtad&#299; came too
late, and the Turks did not leave him time to finish his work.</p>

<p>On the news of the conspiracy against Motazz, M&#363;s&#257;, the son
of the famous general Bogh&#257;,<a name="fa39b" id="fa39b" href="#ft39b"><span class="sp">39</span></a> then governor of Media (Jabal),
ordered his deputy-general Mofli&#7717; to return at once from a proposed
invasion of Dailam, and moved with his army towards
S&#257;marr&#257;, notwithstanding the peremptory orders of the caliph.
At his approach &#7778;&#257;li&#7717;, who was afraid of M&#363;s&#257;, hid himself,
but was soon discovered and killed. At that moment a Kharijite,
named Mos&#257;wir, who in 867 had risen in Mesopotamia and
beaten more than one general of the government, took Balad
and menaced Mos&#363;l. M&#363;s&#257; could not refuse to comply with the
formal command of the caliph to march against him. During
the absence of these troops, Mohtad&#299; seems to have tried to get
rid of the principal Turkish leaders. A brother of Musa and one
of his best generals, B&#257;yikbeg (Baiekb&#257;k), were killed, but the
soldiery he had gained over for himself were not strong enough.
Mohtad&#299; was overwhelmed and killed, Rajab 256 (June 870).</p>

<p>15. <i>Reign of Motamid.</i>&mdash;Whether from weariness or from
repentance, the Turkish soldiery discontinued for a time their
hateful excesses, and their new leader, M&#363;s&#257; b. Bogh&#257;, was
without the greed and ambition of his predecessors. A son of
Motawakkil was brought out of prison to succeed his cousin, and
reigned for twenty-three years under the name of <i>al-Mo&rsquo;tamid
&lsquo;al&#257;&lsquo;ll&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he whose support is God&rdquo;). He was a feeble, pleasure-loving
monarch, but Mohtad&#299; had regained for the Caliphate
some authority, which was exercised by Obaidallah b. Kh&#257;q&#257;n,
the able vizier of Mohtad&#299;, and by Motamid&rsquo;s talented brother
Ab&#363; Ahmad al-Mowaffaq; M&#363;s&#257; b. Bogh&#257; himself remained till
his death a staunch servant of the government. During the
reign of Motamid great events took place. The great power long
wielded by the &#7788;&#257;hirids, not only in the eastern provinces, but
also at Bagdad itself, had been gradually diminishing, and came
to an end in the year 873, when Ya&rsquo;q&#363;b the Saff&#257;rid occupied
N&#299;sh&#257;pur and imprisoned Mahommed b. &#7788;&#257;hir with his whole
family. The power of Ya&rsquo;q&#363;b then increased to such an extent
that he was not content with the caliph&rsquo;s offer to recognize him
as supreme in the provinces he had conquered, and military
governor of Bagdad, but marched against Irak. The caliph
himself, wearing the mantle and the staff of the Prophet, then
went out against him, and after a vigorous resistance he was
beaten by Mowaffaq, who had the command of the troops, and
fled to Jondis&#257;p&#363;r in Kh&#363;zist&#257;n, where he died three years later,
leaving his empire to his brother &lsquo;Amr. This prince maintained
himself in power till the year 900, when he was beaten and taken
prisoner by Ism&#257;&lsquo;&#299;l b. Ahmed the S&#257;m&#257;nid. The S&#257;m&#257;nids had
been governors of Transoxiana from the time of Mamun, and
after the fall of the &#7788;&#257;hirids, had been confirmed in this office
by the caliph. After 287 (900) they were independent princes,
and  under  their  dominion  these  districts  attained  to  high
prosperity.</p>

<p>Motamid had also to deal with a rising of the negro slaves in
the province of Basra, led by one Ali b. Mahommed, who called
himself a descendant of Ali. It lasted from 869 to 883, and tasked
the government to its utmost.<a name="fa40b" id="fa40b" href="#ft40b"><span class="sp">40</span></a></p>

<p>In the west, Ahmad b. T&#363;l&#363;n became a mighty prince, whose
sway extended over Syria and a part of Mesopotamia. Motamid,
who wished to free himself from the guardianship of his brother
Mowaffaq, concerted with him a plan to emigrate to Egypt,
Ahmad being himself angered against Mowaffaq on personal
grounds. Motamid&rsquo;s flight was stopped by his vizier Ibn
Makhlad, and the caliph himself was reconducted to S&#257;marr&#257;
as a prisoner in the year 882. From that time there was war
between the Abbasids and the &#7788;&#363;l&#363;nids. Ahmad died in 270
(884). His son Khom&#257;r&#363;ya succeeded him, and maintained
himself in power till his death in 896, in which year his daughter
was married to the caliph Motadid. Ten years later Egypt was
conquered by a general of the caliph Moktaf&#299;.</p>

<p>During the reign of Motamid the emperor Basil I. conducted
the war against the Moslems with great success, till in the year
270 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 884) his army suffered a terrible defeat near Tarsus,
in which the greater part of the army, the commander Andreas,
and many other patricians perished.</p>

<p>Motamid had appointed his son al-Mofawwid as successor to
the Caliphate, and after him his brother Mowaffaq. When the
latter died in the year 891, his son A&#7685;&#363; &lsquo;l-&lsquo;Abb&#257;s, <i>al-Mo&rsquo;ta&#7693;id</i>
(&ldquo;he who seeks his support in God&rdquo;), was put in his place.
Next year Mofawwid was compelled to abdicate in favour of his
cousin. Shortly after Motamid died, Rajab 279 (October 892).
Not long before these events, the seat of the Caliphate had been
restored to Bagdad.</p>

<p>16. <i>Reign of Motadid</i>.&mdash;Motadid may be called, after Mans&#363;r,
the most able and energetic of all the Abbasid rulers. He took
good care of the finances, reformed the administration, was an
excellent commander in war, and maintained order as far as
possible. The Kharijites in Mesopotamia, who for many years
had molested the government, were finally crushed with the aid
of their former ally &#7716;amd&#257;n, who became the founder of the
well-known dynasty of the &#7716;amd&#257;nites. The mighty house
of Ab&#363; Dolaf in the south-west of Media, which had never
ceased to encroach on the Caliphate, was put down. The
governor of Azerbaijan and Armenia, belonging to the powerful
Turkish house of the S&#257;jids or S&#257;jites, whose loyalty was always
doubtful, planned an invasion of Syria and Egypt. Motadid
frustrated it by a quick movement. The citizens of Tarsus who
were involved in the plot were severely punished. The chief
punishment, however, the burning of the fleet, was a very
impolitic measure, as it strengthened the hands of the Byzantines.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with the rising of the negro slaves
in Basra there arose in the province of K&#363;fa the celebrated
sect of the Carmathians (<i>q.v.</i>), F&#257;timites<a name="fa41b" id="fa41b" href="#ft41b"><span class="sp">41</span></a> or Isma&lsquo;ilites. This
powerful sect, which save for a difference of opinion would have
joined the negro rising, remained outwardly quiet during
Motamid&rsquo;s reign, but under Motadid the government began to
have misgivings about them. Ab&#363; Sa&lsquo;&#299;d al-Jann&#257;b&#299;, who had
founded a Carmathian state in Bahrein, the north-eastern
province of Arabia (actually called La&#7717;s&#257;), which could become
dangerous for the pilgrim road as well as for the commerce of
Basra, in the year 900 routed an army sent against him by
Motadid, and warned the caliph that it would be safer to let the
Carmathians alone. In the same year the real chief of the sect,
whose abode had been discovered by the caliph, fled from
Salamia in Syria, where he lived, to Africa, and hid himself at
Sijilm&#257;sa (in Tafilalt) in the far west, whence he reappeared
ten years later at Kairawan as the Mahdi, the first caliph of the
Fatimites.<a name="fa42b" id="fa42b" href="#ft42b"><span class="sp">42</span></a></p>

<p>Motadid died in Rabia II. <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 289 (March 902), leaving the
Caliphate to his son <i>al-Mokt&#257;f&#299; bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who sufficeth himself
in God&rdquo;).</p>

<p>17. <i>Reign of Moktafi</i>.&mdash;Moktafi inherited his father&rsquo;s intrepidity,
and seems to have had high personal qualities, but his
reign of six years was a constant struggle against the Carmathians
in Syria, who defeated the Syrian and Egyptian troops, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>
conquered Damascus and other cities. Moktafi led his troops
in person, and his general, Mahommed b. Suleim&#257;n, gained a
signal victory. Three of their chiefs were taken and put to death.
But, to avenge their defeat, they lay in wait for the great pilgrim
caravan on its return from Mecca in the first days of 294 (906),
and massacred 20,000 pilgrims, making an immense booty.
This horrible crime raised the whole Moslem world against
them. Zikr&#363;ya their chief was defeated at last and perished.</p>

<p>After the defeat of the Syrian Carmathians, Mahommed b.
Suleim&#257;n was sent by the caliph to Egypt, where he overthrew
the dominion of the T&#363;l&#363;nids. &lsquo;&#298;s&#257; b. Mahommed al-Naushari
was made governor in their stead (905).</p>

<p>The war with the Byzantines was conducted with great energy
during the reign of Moktafi. In the year 905 the Greek general
Andronicus took Marash, and penetrated as far as Haleb
(Aleppo), but the Moslems were successful at sea, and in 907
captured Iconium, whilst Andronicus went over to the caliph&rsquo;s
side, so that the Byzantine emperor sent an embassy to Bagdad
to ask for a truce and an exchange of prisoners.</p>

<p>18. <i>Reign of Moqtadir.</i>&mdash;The sudden death of Moktafi, Dhu&lsquo;l-qa&lsquo;da
295 (August 908), was a fatal blow to the prestige of the
Caliphate, which had revived under the successive governments of
Mowaffaq, Motadid and himself. The new caliph, <i>al-Moqtadir
bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;the powerful through God&rdquo;), a brother of Moktafi, was
only thirteen years of age when he ascended the throne. Owing
to his extreme youth many of the leading men at Bagdad rebelled
and swore allegiance to Abdallah, son of the former caliph
Motazz, a man of excellent character and of great poetical gifts;
but the party of the house of Motadid prevailed, and the rival
caliph was put to death. Moqtadir, though not devoid of noble
qualities, allowed himself to be governed by his mother and her
ladies and eunuchs. He began by squandering the 15,000,000
dinars which were in the treasury when his brother died in
largesses to his courtiers, who, however, merely increased their
demands. His very able vizier, the noble and disinterested
Ali b. &lsquo;&#298;s&#257;, tried to check this foolish expenditure, but his efforts
were more than counterbalanced by the vizier Ibn abi&lsquo;l-For&#257;t
and the court. The most shameless bribery and the robbery
of the well-to-do went together with the most extravagant
luxury. The twenty-four years of Moqtadir&rsquo;s reign are a period
of rapid decay. The most important event in the reign was the
foundation of the F&#257;timite dynasty, which reigned first in the
Maghrib and then in Egypt for nearly three centuries (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fatimites</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Egypt</a></span>: <i>History</i>, &ldquo;Mahommedan&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Far more dangerous, however, for the Caliphate of Bagdad
at the time were the Carmathians of Bahrein, then guided by
Abu &#7788;&#257;hir, the son of Abu Sa&lsquo;&#299;d Jann&#257;bi. In 311 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 923)
they took and ransacked Basra; in the first month of the
following year the great pilgrim caravan on its return from
Mecca was overpowered; 2500 men perished, while an even larger
number were made prisoners and brought to Lahs&#257;, the residence
of the Carmathian princes, together with an immense booty.
The caravan which left Bagdad towards the end of this year
returned in all haste before it had covered a third of the way.
Then Kufa underwent the fate that had befallen Basra. In 313
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 926) the caravan was allowed to pass on payment of a large
sum of money. The government of Bagdad resolved to crush
the Carmathians, but a large army was utterly defeated by Abu
&#7788;&#257;hir in 315 (927), and Bagdad was seriously threatened. Next
year Mecca was taken and plundered; even the sacred Black
Stone was transported to Lahs&#257;, where it remained till 339 (950),
when by the express order of the Im&#257;m, the F&#257;timite caliph, it
was restored to the Ka&lsquo;ba.</p>

<p>In 317 (929) a conspiracy was formed to dethrone Moqtadir,
to which M&#363;nis, the chief commander of the army, at first
assented, irritated by false reports. Very soon he withdrew,
and though he could not prevent the plundering of the palace,
and the proclamation as caliph of another son of Motadid with
the title <i>al-Q&#257;hir bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;the victorious through God&rdquo;), he
rescued Moqtadir and his mother, and at the same time his
imprisoned friend Ali b. &lsquo;&#298;s&#257;, and brought them to his own house.
A few days later, a counter-revolution took place; the leaders
of the revolt were killed, and Moqtadir, against his wish, was
replaced on the throne. In 320 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 932) M&#363;nis, discovering
a court intrigue against him, set out for Mosul, expecting that
the Hamd&#257;nids, who owed to him their power, would join him.
Instead of doing this, they opposed him with a numerous army,
but were defeated. M&#363;nis took Mosul, and having received
reinforcements from all parts, marched against Bagdad. The
caliph, who wished nothing more than to be reconciled to his old
faithful servant, was forced to take arms against him, and fell in
battle Shaww&#257;l 320 (October 932), at the age of 38 years. His
reign, which lasted almost twenty-five years, was in all respects
injurious to the empire.</p>

<p>19. <i>Reign of Q&#257;hir</i>.&mdash;After the victory M&#363;nis acted  with
great moderation and proclaimed a general amnesty. His own
wish was to call Abu Ahmad, a son of Moktafi, or a son of Moqtadir,
to the Caliphate, but the majority of generals preferring
Q&#257;hir because he was an adult man and had no mother at his
side, he acquiesced, although he had a personal dislike for him,
knowing his selfish and cruel character. Q&#257;hir was a drunkard,
and derived the money for his excesses from promiscuous confiscation.
He ill-treated the sons of Moqtadir and Abu Ahmad,
and ultimately assassinated his patrons M&#363;nis and Yalbak,
whose guardianship he resented. In Jomada I. 322 (April
934) he was dethroned and blinded, and died in poverty seven
years later.</p>

<p>During the last years of Moqtadir and the reign of Q&#257;hir a
new dynasty rose. B&#363;ya, the chief of a clan of the Dailam, a
warlike people who inhabit the mountainous country south-west
of the Caspian Sea, had served under the S&#257;m&#257;nids, and found a
footing in the south of Media (Jabal), whence his three sons&mdash;
well known under the titles they assumed at a later period:
&rsquo;Im&#257;d addaula (&ldquo;prop of the dynasty&rdquo;), Rokn addaula (&ldquo;pillar
of the dynasty&rdquo;), and Mo&lsquo;izz addaula (&ldquo;strengthener of the
dynasty&rdquo;)&mdash;succeeded in subduing the province of F&#257;rs, at the
time of Q&#257;hir&rsquo;s dethronement (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Persia</a></span>: <i>History</i>).</p>

<p>20. <i>Reign of Radi</i>.&mdash;Moqtadir&rsquo;s son, who was then proclaimed
caliph under the name of <i>ar-R&#257;d&#299; bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;the content through
God&rdquo;), was pious and well-meaning, but inherited only the
shadow of power. The vizier Ibn Moqla tried to maintain his
authority at least in Irak and Mesopotamia, but without success.
The treasury was exhausted, the troops asked for pay, the people
in Bagdad were riotous. In this extremity the caliph bade
Ibn R&#257;iq, who had made himself master of Basra and W&#257;sit,
and had command of money and men, to come to his help. He
created for him the office of Am&#299;r al-Omar&#257;, &ldquo;Amir of the
Amirs,&rdquo; which nearly corresponds to that of Mayor of the Palace
among the Franks.<a name="fa43b" id="fa43b" href="#ft43b"><span class="sp">43</span></a> Thenceforth the worldly power of the
Caliphate was a mere shadow. The empire was by this time
practically reduced to the province of Bagdad; Khorasan and
Transoxiana were in the hands of the S&#257;m&#257;nids, F&#257;rs in those
of the B&#363;yids; Kirman and Media were under independent
sovereigns; the H&#257;md&#257;nids possessed Mesopotamia; the S&#257;jids
Armenia and Azerbaijan; the Iksh&#299;dites Egypt; as we have
seen, the F&#257;timites Africa, the Carmathians Arabia. The Amir
al-Omar&#257; was obliged to purchase from the latter the freedom
of the pilgrimage to Mecca, at the price of a disgraceful treaty.</p>

<p>During the troubles of the Caliphate the Byzantines had made
great advances; they had even taken Malatia and Samosata
(Samsat). But the great valour of the Hamdanid prince Saif-addaula
checked their march. The Greek army suffered two
severe defeats and sued for peace.</p>

<p>21. <i>Reign of Mottaqi</i>.&mdash;Radi died in Rabia I. <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 329 (December
940). Another son of Moqtadir was then proclaimed caliph
under the name of <i>al-Mottaq&#299; bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who guards himself by
God&rdquo;). At the time of his accession the Am&#299;r al-Omar&#257; was the
Turkish general Bajkam, in whose favour Ibn R&#257;iq had been
obliged to retire. Unfortunately Bajkam died soon after, and
his death was followed by general anarchy. A certain Bar&#299;d&#299;,
who had carved out for himself a principality in the province of
Basra, marched against Bagdad and made himself master of
the capital, but was soon driven out by the Dailamite general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
K&#363;rtak&#299;n. Ibn R&#257;iq came back and reinstated himself as Am&#299;r
al-Omar&#257;. But Bar&#299;d&#299; again laid siege to Bagdad, and Mottaqi
fled to N&#257;sir addaula the Hamd&#257;nid prince of Mosul, who then
marched against Bagdad, and succeeded in repelling Bar&#299;d&#299;.
In return he obtained the office of Am&#299;r al-Omar&#257;. But the
Dailamite and Turkish soldiery did not suffer him to keep this
office longer than several months. T&#363;z&#363;n, a former captain of
Bajkam, compelled him to return to Mosul and took his place.
Mottaqi fled again to Mosul and thence to Rakka. The Iksh&#299;d,
sovereign of Egypt and Syria, offered him a refuge, but T&#363;z&#363;n,
fearing to see the caliph obtain such powerful support, found
means to entice him to his tent, and had his eyes put out, Saphar
333 (October 944).</p>

<p>22. <i>Reign of Mostakfi.</i>&mdash;As successor T&#363;z&#363;n chose <i>al-Mostakf&#299;
bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who finds full sufficiency with God&rdquo;), a son of
Moktafi. This prince, still more than his predecessors, was
a mere puppet in the hands of T&#363;z&#363;n, who died a few months
later, and his successor Ibn Sh&#299;rz&#257;d. Such was the weakness
of the caliph that a notorious robber, named Hamd&#299;, obtained
immunity for his depredations by a monthly payment of 25,000
dinars. One of the B&#363;yid princes,  whose power had been
steadily increasing, marched about this time against Bagdad,
which he entered in Jomada I. <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 334 (December 945), and was
acknowledged by the caliph as legal sovereign, under the title
of Sultan. He assumed at this time the name of Mo&lsquo;izz addaula.
Mostakfi was soon weary of this new master, and plotted against
him. At least Mo&lsquo;izz addaula suspected him and deprived him
of his eyesight, Jomada II. <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 334 (January 946). There were
thus in Bagdad three caliphs who had been dethroned and
blinded, Q&#257;hir, Mottaqi and Mostakfi.</p>

<p>23. <i>Reign  of Moti.</i>&mdash;Mo&lsquo;izz  addaula soon abandoned his
original idea of restoring the title of caliph to one of the descendants
of Ali, fearing a strong opposition of the people, and also
dreading lest this should lead to the recovery by the caliphs of
their former supremacy. His choice fell on a son of Moqtadir,
who took the title of <i>al-Moti&rsquo; bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who obeys God&rdquo;).
The sultan, reserving to himself all the powers and revenues of
the Caliphate, allowed the caliph merely a secretary and a pension
of 5000 dirhems a day. Though in public prayers and on the
coins the name of the caliph remained as that of the supreme
authority, he had in reality no authority out of the palace, so
that the saying became proverbial, &ldquo;he contents himself with
sermon and coin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Hamd&#257;nid prince of Mosul, who began to think his
possessions threatened by Mo&lsquo;izz addaula, tried without success
to wrest Bagdad from him, and was obliged to submit to the
payment of tribute. He died in 358 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 969), and ten years
later the power of this branch of the Hamdanids came to an end.
The representative of the other branch, Saif addaula, the prince
of Haleb (Aleppo), conducted the war against the Byzantines
with great valour till his death in 356 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 967), but could not
stop the progress of the enemy. His descendants maintained
themselves, but with very limited power, till <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 413 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1022).</p>

<p>Mo&lsquo;izz addaula died in the same year as Saif addaula, leaving
his power to his son Bakhtiy&#257;r &lsquo;Izz addaula, who lacked his
father&rsquo;s energy and loved pleasure more than business.</p>

<p>While the Abb&#257;sid dynasty was thus dying out in shame and
degradation, the F&#257;timites, in the person of Mo&lsquo;izz li-d&#299;n-allah
(or Mo&lsquo;izz Abu Tamin Ma&lsquo;add) (&ldquo;he who makes God&rsquo;s religion
victorious&rdquo;), were reaching the highest degree of power and
glory in spite of the opposition of the Carmathians, who left
their old allegiance and entered into negotiations with the court
of Bagdad, offering to drive back the F&#257;timites, on condition of
being assisted with money and troops, and of being rewarded
with the government of Syria and Egypt. The former condition
was granted, but the caliph emphatically refused the latter
demand, saying: &ldquo;Both parties are Carmathians, they profess
the same religion and are enemies of Islam.&rdquo; The Carmathians
drove the F&#257;timites out of Syria, and threatened Egypt, but,
notwithstanding their intrepidity, they were not able to cope
with their powerful rival, who, however, in his turn could not
bring them to submission. In 978-979 peace was made on
condition that the Carmathians should evacuate Syria for an
annual payment of 70,000 dinars. But the losses sustained by
the Carmathians during that struggle had been enormous.
Their power henceforward declined, and came to an end in <span class="sc">a.h.</span>
474 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1081).</p>

<p>Mo&lsquo;izz addaula, as we have seen, professed a great veneration
for the house of Ali. He not only caused the mourning for the
death of Hosain and other Shi&lsquo;ite festivals to be celebrated at
Bagdad, but also allowed imprecations against Moawiya and
even against Mahomet&rsquo;s wife Ayesha and the caliphs Abu
Bekr, Omar and Othman, to be posted up at the doors of the
mosques. These steps annoyed the people and the Turkish
soldiery, who were Sunnites, and led at last to an insurrection.
Moti was compelled to abdicate, and Bakhtiy&#257;r was driven out
of Bagdad Dhu&lsquo;l-qa&lsquo;da 363 (August 974).</p>

<p>24. <i>Reign of Tai.</i>&mdash;Moti left the empty title of caliph to his son
<i>al-T&#257;&lsquo;i li-amri&lsquo;ll&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;the obedient to the command of God&rdquo;).
The Turks who had placed him on the throne could not maintain
themselves, but so insignificant was the person of the caliph
that &lsquo;Adod addaula, who succeeded his cousin Bakhtiy&#257;r in
Bagdad, did not think of replacing him by another. Under this
prince, or king, as he was called, the power of the B&#363;yids reached
its zenith. His empire stretched from the Caspian to the Persian
Sea, and in the west to the eastern frontier of Syria. He did
his best to remedy the misery caused by the intestine Wars,
repaired the ruined mosques and other public edifices, founded
hospitals and libraries&mdash;his library in Shir&#257;z was one of the
wonders of the world&mdash;and improved irrigation. It was also he
who built the mausoleum of Hosain at Kerbela, and that of Ali
at Kufa. But after his death in the year 372 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 983), his
sons, instead of following the example of their predecessors,
the three sons of B&#363;ya, fought one against the other. In 380
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 990) the youngest of them, Bah&#257; addaula, had the upper
hand. This prince, who was as avaricious as he was ambitious,
wishing to deprive the caliph Ta&lsquo;i of his possessions, compelled
him to abdicate <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 381 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 991).</p>

<p>25. <i>Reign of Q&#257;dir.</i>&mdash;A grandson of Moqtadir was then made
caliph under the name of <i>al-Q&#257;dir bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;the powerful through
God&rdquo;). The only deed of power, however, that is recorded of
him, is that he opposed himself to the substitution of a Shi&lsquo;ite
head cadi for the Sunnite, so that Bah&#257; addaula had to content
himself with giving to the Shi&lsquo;ites a special judge, to whom he
gave the title of <i>naq&#299;b</i> (superintendent). During this caliphate
the B&#363;yid princes were in continual war with one another.
Meanwhile events were preparing the fall of their dynasty. In
350 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 961) a Turkish general of the S&#257;m&#257;nids had founded for
himself a principality in Ghazni, arid at his death in 366 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>
976) his successor Sabuktagin had conquered Bost in Sijist&#257;n
and Qosd&#257;r in Baluchistan, beaten the Indian prince Diaya
Pala, and been acknowledged as master of the lands west of the
Indus.  At his death in 387 his son Mahmud conquered the
whole of Khorasan and Sijist&#257;n, with a great part of India.   He
then attacked the B&#363;yids, and would have destroyed their
dynasty but for his death in the year 421 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1030).</p>

<p>In 389 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 999) Ilek-kh&#257;n, the prince of Turkistan, took
Bokh&#257;r&#257; and made an end to the glorious state of the S&#257;m&#257;nids,
the last prince of which was murdered in 395 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1005). The
S&#257;m&#257;nids had long been a rampart of the Caliphate against the
Turks, whom they held under firm control. From their fall
dates the invasion of the empire by that people. The greatest
gainer for the moment was Mahm&#363;d of Ghazni. In Mesopotamia
and Irak several petty states arose on the ruins of the dominions
of the Hamd&#257;nids and of the Abbasids.</p>

<p>Q&#257;dir died in the last month of <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 422 (November 1031).
He is the author of some theological treatises.</p>

<p>26. <i>Reign of Q&#257;im</i>.&mdash;He was succeeded by his son, who at his
accession took the title of <i>al-Q&#257;im bi-amri&lsquo;ll&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who maintains
the cause of God&rdquo;). During the first half of his long reign
took place the development of the power of the Gh&#363;zz, a great
Turkish tribe, who took the name Seljuk from Seljuk their chief in
Transoxiana. Already during the reign of Mahm&#363;d large bodies
had passed the Oxus and spread over Khorasan and the adjacent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>
countries. In the time of his successor the bulk of the tribe
followed, and in the year 429 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1038) Toghrul Beg, their
chief, beat the army of the Ghaznevids and made his entry into
Nishapur. Thenceforth this progress was rapid (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Seljuks</a></span>).
The situation in Bagdad had become so desperate that the caliph
called Toghrul to his aid. This prince entered Bagdad in the
month of Ramadan <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 447 (December 1055), and overthrew
finally the dynasty of the B&#363;yids.<a name="fa44b" id="fa44b" href="#ft44b"><span class="sp">44</span></a> In 449 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1058) the caliph
gave him the title of &ldquo;King of the East and West.&rdquo; But in the
following year, 450, during his absence, the Shi&lsquo;ites made themselves
masters of the metropolis, and proclaimed the Caliphate
of the F&#257;timite prince Mostansir. They were soon overthrown
by Toghrul, who was now supreme, and compelled the caliph
to give him his daughter in marriage. Before the marriage,
however, he died, and was succeeded by his nephew Alp Arsl&#257;n,
who died in 465 (25th December) (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1072). Q&#257;im died two
years later, Shaaban <span class="sc">a.h.</span> 467 (April 1075).</p>

<p>In the year 440 Mo&lsquo;izz b. B&#257;d&#299;s, the Zeirid ruler of the Maghrib,
made himself independent, and substituted in prayer the name
of the Abbasid caliph for that of Mostansir. In order to punish
him, the latter gave permission to the Arab tribes in Egypt to
cross the Nile, and granted them possession of all the lands they
should conquer. This happened in 442 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1050) and was of
the greatest significance for the subsequent fate of Africa.</p>

<p>27. <i>Reign of Moqtadi</i>.&mdash;In the first year of the Caliphate of
<i>al-Moqtad&#299; bi-amri&lsquo;ll&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who follows the orders of God&rdquo;), a
grandson of Q&#257;im, the power of the Seljuk empire reached its
zenith. All the eastern provinces, a great part of Asia Minor,
Syria with the exception of a few towns on the shore, the main
part of West Africa acknowledged the caliph of Bagdad as the
Im&#257;m. Yemen had been subjected, and at Mecca and Medina
his name was substituted in the public prayers for that of the
F&#257;timite caliph. But after the death of Malik-Shah a contest
for the sultanate took place. The caliph, who had in 1087
married the daughter of Malik-Shah, had been compelled two
years after to send her back to her father, as she complained of
being neglected by her husband.  Just before his death, the
Sultan had ordered him to transfer his residence from Bagdad to
Basra.  After his death he stayed and supported the princess
Turk&#257;n Kh&#257;t&#363;n. This lost him his life. The day after Barki-y&#257;roq&rsquo;s
triumphant entry into Bagdad, Muharram 487 (February
1094), he died suddenly, apparently by poison.</p>

<p>28. <i>Reign of Mostazhir</i>.&mdash;<i>Al-Mostazhir bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who seeks
to triumph through God&rdquo;), son of Moqtadi, was only sixteen
years old when he was proclaimed caliph. His reign is memorable
chiefly for the growing power of the Assassins (<i>q.v.</i>) and for the
first Crusade (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Crusades</a></span>). The Seljuk princes were too much
absorbed by internal strife to concentrate against the new
assailants. After the death of Barkiy&#257;roq in November 1104,
his brother Mahommed reigned till April 1118. His death was
followed about four months later by that of Mostazhir.</p>

<p>29. <i>Reign of Mostarshid.</i>&mdash;<i>Al-Mostarshid bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who asks
guidance from God&rdquo;), who succeeded his father in Rabia II. 512
(August 1118), distinguished himself by a vain attempt to reestablish
the power of the caliph. Towards the end of the year
529 (October 1134) he was compelled to promise that he would
confine himself to his palace and never again take the field. Not
long after he was assassinated. About the same time Dobais
was killed, a prince of the family of the Banu Mazyad, who had
founded the Arabian state of Hillah in the vicinity of the ruins
of Babel in 1102.</p>

<p>30. <i>Reign of R&#257;shid.</i>&mdash;<i>Al-R&#257;shid  bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;the just through
God&rdquo;) tried to follow the steps of his father, with the aid of
Zeng&#299;, the prince of Mosul. But the sultan Mas&lsquo;&#363;d beat the army
of the allies, took Bagdad and had R&#257;shid deposed (August 1136).
R&#257;shid escaped, but was murdered two years later.</p>

<p>31. <i>Reign of Moqtafi.</i>&mdash;His successor <i>Al-Moqtafi li-amri&lsquo;ll&#257;h</i>
(&ldquo;he who follows the orders of God&rdquo;), son of Mostazhir,  had
better success. He was real ruler not only of the district of
Bagdad, but also of the rest of Irak, which he subdued by force.
He died in the month of Rabia II. 555 (March 1160). Under his
reign the central power of the Seljuks was rapidly sinking. In
the west of Atabeg (prince&rsquo;s guardian) Zeng&#299;, the prince of
Mosul, had extended his dominion over Mesopotamia and the
north of Syria, where he had been the greatest defender of Islam
against the Franks. At his death in the year 541 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1146),
his noble son, the well-known N&#363;redd&#299;n, who was called &ldquo;the
just king,&rdquo; continued his father&rsquo;s glorious career. Transoxiana
was conquered by the heathen hordes of Khat&#257;, who towards the
end of 535 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1141) under the king Ghurkh&#257;n defeated the
great army of the Seljuk prince and compelled the Turkish
tribes of the Ghuzz to cross the Oxus and to occupy Khorasan.</p>

<p>32. <i>Reign of Mostanjid.</i>&mdash;<i>Al-Mostanjid bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who
invokes help from God&rdquo;), the son of Moqtafi, enlarged the
dominion of the Caliphate by making an end to the state of the
Mazyadites in Hillah.  His allies were the Arabic tribe of the
Montafiq, who thenceforth were powerful in southern Irak. The
greatest event towards the end of his Caliphate was the conquest
of Egypt by the army of N&#363;redd&#299;n, the overthrow of the F&#257;timite
dynasty, and the rise of Saladin. He was killed by his majordomo
in Rabia II. 566 (December 1170).</p>

<p>33. <i>Reign of Mostadi.</i>&mdash;His son and successor <i>al-Mostad&#299;&rsquo; bi-amri&lsquo;ll&#257;h</i>
(&ldquo;he who seeks enlightenment by the orders of God &ldquo;),
though in Egypt his name was now substituted in public prayers
for that of the F&#257;timite caliph, was unable to obtain any real
authority. By the death of N&#363;redd&#299;n in 569 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1174) Saladin&rsquo;s
power became firmly rooted. The dynasty founded by him is
called that of the Ayy&#363;bites, after the name of his father Ayy&#363;b.
Mostadi died in the month of Dhu&lsquo;l-qa&lsquo;da 575 (March 1180).</p>

<p>34. <i>Reign of N&#257;sir.</i>&mdash;Quite a different man from his father was his
successor <i>al-N&#257;sir li-d&#299;ni&lsquo;ll&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who helps the religion of God&rdquo;).
During his reign Jerusalem was reconquered by Saladin, 27 Rajab
583 (October 2nd, 1187). Not long before that event the well-known
Spanish traveller Ibn Jubair visited the empire of Saladin,
and came to Bagdad in 580, where he saw the caliph himself.
N&#257;sir was very ambitious; he had added Kh&#363;zist&#257;n to his
dominions, and desired to become also master of Media (Jabal, or
Persian Irak, as it was called in the time of the Seljuks). Here,
however, he came into conflict with the then mighty prince of
Khw&#257;rizm (Kh&#299;va), who, already exasperated because the
caliph refused to grant him the honours he asked for, resolved
to overthrow the Caliphate of the Abbasids, and to place a
descendant of Ali on the throne of Bagdad. In his anxiety,
N&#257;sir took a step which brought the greatest misery upon
western Asia, or at least accelerated its arrival.</p>

<p>In the depths of Asia a great conglomeration of east Turkish
tribes (Tatars or Mongols), formed by a terrible warrior, known
under his honorific title Jenghiz Kh&#257;n, had conquered the
northern provinces of China, and extended its power to the
frontiers of the Transoxianian regions. To this heathen chief the
Im&#257;m of the Moslems sent a messenger, inducing him to attack
the prince of Khw&#257;rizm, who already had provoked the Mongolian
by a disrespectful treatment of his envoys. Neither he nor
the caliph had the slightest notion of the imminent danger they
conjured up. When N&#257;sir died, Ramadan 622 (October 1225),
the eastern provinces of the empire had been trampled down by
the wild hordes, the towns burned, and the inhabitants killed
without mercy.</p>

<p>35. <i>Reign of Z&#257;hir</i>.&mdash;<i>Al-Z&#257;hir bi-amri&lsquo;ll&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;the victorious
through the orders of God&rdquo;) died within a year after his father&rsquo;s
death, in Rajab 623 (July 1226). He and his son and successor
are praised as beneficent and just princes.</p>

<p>36. <i>Reign of Mostansir</i>.&mdash;<i>Al-Mostansir bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who asks
help from God&rdquo;) was caliph till his death in Jornada II. 640
(December 1242). In the year 624 (1227) Jenghiz Kh&#257;n died,
but the Mongol invasion continued to advance with immense
strides. The only man who dared, and sometimes with success,
to combat them was Jelaleddin, the ex-king of Khw&#257;rizm, but
after his death in 628 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1231) all resistance was paralysed.</p>

<p>37. <i>Reign of Mostasim</i>.&mdash;<i>Al-Mosta&lsquo;&#7779;im bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who clings
to God for protection&rdquo;), son of Mostansir, the last caliph of
Bagdad, was a narrow-minded, irresolute man, guided moreover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
by bad counsellors. In the last month of the year 653 (January
1256) Hulaku or Hulagu, the brother of the gteat kh&#257;n of the
Mongols, crossed the Oxus, and began by destroying all the
strongholds of the Ism&#257;&lsquo;&#299;l&#299;s. Then the turn of Bagdad came.
On the 11th of Muharram 656 (January 1258) Hulaku arrived
under the walls of the capital. In vain did Mostasim sue for
peace. Totally devoid of dignity and heroism, he ended by
surrendering and imploring mercy from the barbarian victor.
On the 4th of Saphar (February 10th) he came with his retinue into
the camp. The city was then given up to plunder and slaughter;
many public buildings were burnt; the caliph, after having
been compelled to bring forth all the hidden treasures of the
family, was killed with two of his sons and many relations.
With him expired the eastern Caliphate of the Abbasids,
which had lasted 524 years, from the entry of Abu&rsquo;I-Abbas into
Kufa.</p>

<p>In vain, three years later, did Abu&rsquo;I-Qasim Ahmad, a scion of
the race of the Abbasids, who had taken refuge in Egypt with
Bibars the Mameluke sultan, and who had been proclaimed
caliph under the title <i>al-Mostan&#7779;ir bill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who seeks help
from God&rdquo;), make an effort to restore a dynasty which was now
for ever extinct. At the head of an army he marched against
Bagdad, but was defeated and killed before he reached that city.
Then another descendant of the Abbasids, who also had found an
asylum in Egypt, was proclaimed caliph at Cairo under the name
of <i>al-H&#257;kim bi-amrill&#257;h</i> (&ldquo;he who decides according to the
orders of God&rdquo;). His sons inherited his title, but, like their
father, remained in Egypt without power or influence (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Egypt</a></span>:
<i>History</i>, &ldquo;Mahommedan period&rdquo;). This shadow of sovereignty
continued to exist till the conquest of Egypt by the Turkish
sultan Selim I., who compelled the last of them, Motawakkil, to
abdicate in his favour (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Turkey</a></span>: <i>History</i>). He died at
Cairo, a pensionary of the Ottoman government, in 1538.</p>

<p>Another scion of the Abbasid family, Mahommed, a great-grandson
of the caliph Mostansir, found at a later period a
refuge in India, where the sultan of Delhi received him with
the greatest respect, named him Makhdumz&#257;deh, &ldquo;the Master&rsquo;s
son,&rdquo; and treated him as a prince. Ibn Bat&#363;ta saw him when
he visited India, and says that he was very avaricious. On his
return to Bagdad the traveller found there a young man, son of
this prince, who gained a single dirhem daily for serving as im&#257;m
in a mosque, and did not get the least relief from his rich father.
It seems that this Mahommed, or his son, emigrated later to
Sumatra, where in the old Sam&#363;tra the graves of their descendants
have been lately discovered.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALIXTUS,<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Callistus</span>, the name of three popes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Calixtus I</span>., pope from 217 to 222, was little known before
the discovery of the book of the <i>Philosophumena</i>. From this
work, which is in part a pamphlet directed against him, we
learn that Calixtus was originally a slave and engaged in banking.
Falling on evil times, he was brought into collision with the
Jews, who denounced him as a Christian and procured his exile
to Sardinia. On his return from exile he was pensioned by Pope
Victor, and, later, was associated by Pope Zephyrinus in the
government of the Roman church. On the death of Zephyrinus
(217) he was elected in his place and occupied the papal chair
for five years. His theological adversary Hippolytus, the author
of the <i>Philosophumena</i>, accused him of having favoured the
medalist or Patripassian doctrines both before and after his
election. Calixtus, however, condemned Sabellius, the most
prominent champion of that system. Hippolytus accused him
also of certain relaxations of discipline. It appears that Calixtus
reduced the penitential severities applied until his time to
those guilty of adultery and other analogous sins. Under
Calixtus and his two immediate successors, Hippolytus was
the leader of a schismatic group, organized by way of protest
against the election of Calixtus. Calixtus died in 222, in circumstances
obscured by legends. In the time of Constantine
the Roman church reckoned him officially among the martyr
popes.</p>
<div class="author">(L. D.*)</div>

<p><span class="sc">Calixtus II</span>. (d. 1124), pope from 1119 to 1124, was Guido,
a member of a noble Burgundian family, who became archbishop
of Vienne about 1088, and belonged to the party which favoured
reform in the Church. In September 1112, after Pope Paschal II.
had made a surrender to the emperor Henry V., Guido called a
council at Vienne, which declared against lay investiture, and
excommunicated Henry. In February 1119 he was chosen pope
at Cluny in succession to Gelasius II., and in opposition to the
anti-pope Gregory VIII., who was in Rome. Soon after his
consecration he opened negotiations with the emperor with a
view to settling the dispute over investiture. Terms of peace
were arranged, but at the last moment difficulties arose and the
treaty was abandoned; and in October 1119 both emperor and
anti-pope were excommunicated at a synod held at Reims.
The journey of Calixtus to Rome early in 1120 was a triumphal
march. He was received with great enthusiasm in the city,
while Gregory, having fled to Sutri, was delivered into his hands
and treated with great ignominy. Through the efforts of some
German princes negotiations between pope and emperor were
renewed, and the important Concordat of Worms made in
September 1122 was the result. This treaty, made possible by
concessions on either side, settled the investiture controversy,
and was confirmed by the Lateran council of March 1123.
During his short reign Calixtus strengthened the authority of
the papacy in southern Italy by military expeditions, and restored
several buildings within the city of Rome. During preparations
for a crusade he died in Rome on the 13th or 14th of December
1124.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Calixtus III</span>. (<i>c.</i> 1378-1458), pope from 1455 to 1458, was a
Spaniard named Alphonso de Borgia, or Borja. A native of
Xativa, he gained a great reputation as a jurist, becoming professor
at Lerida; in 1429 he was made bishop of Valencia, and
in 1444 a cardinal, owing his promotion mainly to his close
friendship with Alphonso V., king of Aragon and Sicily. Chosen
pope in April 1455, he was very anxious to organize a crusade
against the Turks, and having sold many of his possessions,
succeeded in equipping a fleet. Neither the princes nor the
people of Europe, however, were enthusiastic in this cause,
and very little result came from the pope&rsquo;s exertions. During
his papacy Calixtus became involved in a quarrel with his former
friend, Alphonso of Aragon, now also king of Naples, and after
the king&rsquo;s death in June 1458 he refused to recognize his illegitimate
son, Ferdinand, as king of Naples, asserting that this
kingdom was a fief of the Holy See. This pope was notorious for
nepotism, and was responsible for introducing his nephew,
Rodrigo Borgia, afterwards Pope Alexander VI., to Rome. He
died on the 6th of August 1458.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALIXTUS, GEORG<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> (1586-1656), Lutheran divine, was born
at Medelby, a village of Schleswig, in 1586. After studying
philology, philosophy and theology at Helmst√§dt, Jena, Giessen,
T√ºbingen and Heidelberg, he travelled through Holland, France
and England, where he became acquainted with the leading
Reformers. On his return in 1614 he was appointed professor
of theology at Helmst√§dt by the duke of Brunswick, who had
admired the ability he displayed when a young man in a dispute
with the Jesuit Augustine Turrianus. In 1613 he published a
book, <i>Disputationes de Praecipuis Religionis Christianae Capitibus</i>,
which provoked the hostile criticism of orthodox scholars; in
1619 he published his <i>Epitome theologiae</i>, and some years later
his <i>Theologia Moralis</i> (1634) and <i>De Arte Nova Nihusii</i>. Roman
Catholics felt them to be aimed at their own system, but they
gave so great offence to Lutherans as to induce Statius Buscher
to charge the author with a secret leaning to Romanism. Scarcely
had he refuted the accusation of Buscher, when, on account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>
his intimacy with the Reformed divines at the conference of
Thorn (1645), and his desire to effect a reconciliation between
them and the Lutherans, a new charge was preferred against him,
principally at the instance of Abraham Calovius (1612-1686), of
a secret attachment to Calvinism. In fact, the great aim of his
life was to reconcile Christendom by removing all unimportant
differences. The disputes to which this attitude gave rise,
known in the Church as the Syncretistic controversy, lasted
during the whole lifetime of Calixtus, and distracted the Lutheran
church, till a new controversy arose with P.J. Spener and the
Pietists of Halle. Calixtus died in 1656.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALL<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> (from Anglo-Saxon <i>ceallian</i>, a common Teutonic word,
cf. Dutch <i>kallen</i>, to talk or chatter), to speak in a loud voice, and
particularly to attract some one&rsquo;s attention by a loud utterance.
Hence its use for a visit at a house, where the name of the
occupier, to whom the visit was made, was called aloud, in early
times, to indicate the presence of the visitor. It is thus transferred
to a short stay at a place, but usually with the idea of a
specific purpose, as in &ldquo;port of call,&rdquo; where ships stop in passing.
Connected with the idea of summoning by name are such uses as
&ldquo;roll-call&rdquo; or &ldquo;call-over,&rdquo; where names are called over and
answered by those present; similar uses are the &ldquo;call to the
bar,&rdquo; the summoning at an Inn of Court of those students
qualified to practise as barristers, and the &ldquo;call within the bar&rdquo;
to the appointment of king&rsquo;s counsel. In the first case the &ldquo;bar&rdquo;
is that which separates the benchers from the rest of the body
of members of the Inn, in the other the place in a court of law
within which only king&rsquo;s counsel, and formerly serjeants-at-law,
are allowed to plead. &ldquo;Call&rdquo; is also used with a particular
reference to a divine summons, as of the calling of the apostles.
It is thus used in nonconformist churches of the invitation to
serve as minister a particular congregation or chapel. It is from
this sense of a <i>vocatio</i> or summons that the word &ldquo;calling&rdquo; is
used, not only of the divine vocation, but of a man&rsquo;s ordinary
profession, occupation or business. In card games &ldquo;call&rdquo; is
used, in poker, of the demand that the hand of the highest
bettor be exposed or seen, exercised by that player who equals
his bet; in whist or bridge, of a certain method of play, the
&ldquo;call&rdquo; for a suit or for trumps on the part of one partner, to
which the other is expected to respond; and in many card
games for the naming of a card, irregularly exposed, which is
laid face up on the table, and may be thus &ldquo;called&rdquo; for, at
any point the opponent may choose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call&rdquo; is also a term on the English and American stock
exchanges for a contract by which, in consideration of a certain
sum, an &ldquo;option&rdquo; is given by the person making or signing the
agreement to another named therein or his order or to bearer,
to &ldquo;call&rdquo; for a specified amount of stock at a certain day for a
certain price. A &ldquo;put,&rdquo; which is the reverse of a &ldquo;call,&rdquo; is the
option of selling (putting) stock at a certain day for a certain
price. A combined option of either calling or putting is termed
a &ldquo;straddle,&rdquo; and sometimes on the American stock exchange a
&ldquo;spread-eagle.&rdquo; (See further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Stock Exchange</a></span>.) The word is also
used, in connexion with joint-stock companies, to signify a demand
for instalments due on shares, when the capital of the company
has not been demanded or &ldquo;called&rdquo; up at once. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Company</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALLAO,<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> a city, port and coast department of Peru, 8¬Ω m.
west of Lima, in 12¬∞ 04&prime; S., 77¬∞ 13&prime; W. Pop. (1905) 31,128, of
whom 3349 were foreigners. The department includes the city
and its environs, Bellavista and La Punta, and the neighbouring
islands, San Lorenzo, Fronton, the Palominos, &amp;c., and covers
an area of 14¬Ω sq. m. Callao is the principal port of the republic,
its harbour being a large bay sheltered by a tongue of land on the
south called La Punta, and by the islands of San Lorenzo and
Fronton. The anchorage is good and safe, and the harbour is
one of the best on the Pacific coast of South America. The city
stands on the south side of the bay, and is built on a flat point of
land only 8 ft. above sea-level. The houses are for the most
part low and cheaply built, and the streets are narrow, badly
paved, irregular and dirty. The climate is good and the coast
is swept by cool ocean breezes, the average temperatures
ranging from 65¬∞ to 77¬∞ F., but notwithstanding this, Callao
has a bad reputation for fevers and contagious diseases, chiefly
because of its insanitary condition. Its noteworthy public
buildings are the custom-house and its storehouses which occupy
the old quadrangular fortress built by the Spanish government
between 1770 and 1775, and cover 15 acres, the prefecture, the
military and naval offices and barracks, the post-office, three
Catholic churches, a hospital, market, three clubs and some
modern commercial houses. The present city is half a mile north
of the site of the old town, which was destroyed by an earthquake
and tidal wave in 1746. For a short time the commercial
interests of the stricken city centred at Bellavista, 1¬º m. east,
where wheat granaries were built and still remain, but later the
greater convenience of a waterside site drew the merchants and
population back to the vicinity of the submerged town. The
importance of Callao in colonial times, when it was the only open
port south of Panama, did not continue under the new political
order, because of the unsettled state of public affairs and the loss
of its monopoly. This decline in its prosperity was checked,
and the modern development of the port began, when a railway
was built from Callao into the heart of the Andes, and Callao is
now an important factor in the development of copper-mining.
The port is connected with Lima by two railways and an electric
tramway, with Oroya by railway 138 m. long, and with Cerro
de Pasco by railway 221 m. A short railway also runs from the
port to the Bellavista storehouses. The port is provided with
modern harbour improvements, consisting of sea-walls of concrete
blocks, two fine docks with berthing spaces for 30 large vessels,
and a large floating-dock (300 ft. long on the blocks and capable
of receiving vessels up to 21 ft. draught and 5000 tons weight),
which was built in Glasgow and was sent out to Callao in 1863.
The docks are provided with gas and electric lights, 18 steam
cranes for loading and discharging vessels, a triple line of railway
and a supply of fresh water. Callao was formerly the headquarters
in South America of the Pacific Steam Navigation
Co., Ltd. (incorporated 1840), but Valparaiso now occupies
that position. There are, owing perhaps to the proximity of
Lima, few industrial establishments in the city; among them are
a large sugar refinery, some flour-mills, a brewery, a factory
for making effervescent drinks, and a number of foundries and
repair shops. Being a port of the first class, Callao is an important
distributing centre for the coasting trade, in which a
large number of small vessels are engaged. The foreign steamship
companies making it a regular port of call are the Pacific
Steam Navigation Co. (British), the Compa√±ia Sud-America
(Chilean), the Kosmos and Roland lines (German), the Merchants
line (New York), and a Japanese line from the ports of Japan
and China. A subsidized Peruvian line is also contemplated to
ply between the Pacific ports of South America with an eventual
extension of the service to Europe. The arrivals from and
clearances for foreign ports in 1907 were as follows:&mdash;</p>

silver, copper, gold and forest products, and the imports include
timber and other building materials, cotton and other textiles,
general merchandise for personal, household and industrial
uses, railway material, coal, kerosene, wheat, flour and other
food stuffs. The maintenance of peace and order, and the mining
development of the interior, have added to the trade and prosperity
of the port.</p>

<p>The history of Callao has been exceptionally eventful. It was
founded in 1537, two years after Pizarro had founded Lima.
As the port of that capital and the only open port below Panama
it grew rapidly in importance and wealth. It was raised to the
dignity of a city in 1671. The appearance of Sir Francis Drake
in the bay in 1578 led to the fortification of the port, which
proved strong enough to repel an attack by the Dutch in 1624.
The city was completely destroyed and partly submerged by the
great earthquake of the 28th of October 1746, in which about
6000 persons perished. The new city was strongly fortified and
figured prominently in the struggle for independence, and also
in the various revolutions which have convulsed the republic.
Its political autonomy dates from 1836, when it was made a
coast department. The Callao fortifications were bombarded by
a Spanish fleet under Admiral Mendez Nu√±ez on the 2nd of May
1866, when there were heavy losses both in lives and material.
Again, in 1880, the city was bombarded by the Chileans, though
it was almost defenceless, and fell into the possession of the
invaders after the capture of Lima in the following year. Before
the surrender all the Peruvian naval vessels in the harbour were
sunk, to prevent their falling into the possession of the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALLCOTT, SIR AUGUSTUS WALL<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (1779-1844), English
landscape painter, was born at Kensington in 1779 and died
there in 1844. His first study was music; and he sang for
several years in the choir of Westminster Abbey. But at the age
of twenty he had determined to give up music, and had exhibited
his first painting at the Royal Academy. He gradually rose to
distinction, and was elected an associate in 1807 and an academician
in 1810. In 1827 he received the honour of knighthood;
and, seven years later, was appointed surveyor of the royal
pictures. His two principal subject pictures&mdash;&ldquo;Raphael and
the Fornarina,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Milton dictating to his Daughters,&rdquo; are
much inferior to his landscapes, which are placed in the highest
class by their refined taste and quiet beauty.</p>

<p>His wife, <span class="sc">Maria</span>, Lady Callcott (1786-1844), whom he married
in 1827, was a daughter of Admiral Dundas and widow of
Captain Thomas Graham, R.N. (d. 1822). With her first husband
she travelled in India, South Africa and South America, where
she acted for some time as teacher of Donna Maria, who became
queen of Portugal in 1826; and in the company of her second
husband she spent much time in the south of Europe. She
published accounts of her visits to India (1812), and to the
environs of Rome (1820); <i>Memoirs of Poussin</i> (1820); a
<i>History of France</i>; a <i>History of Spain</i> (1828); <i>Essays toward a
History of Painting</i> (1836); <i>Little Arthur&rsquo;s History of England</i>
(1836); and the <i>Scripture Herbal</i> (1842).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALLCOTT, JOHN WALL<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (1766-1821), English musician,
brother of Sir Augustus Callcott, was born at Kensington on the
20th of November 1766. At the age of seven he was sent to a
neighbouring day-school, where he continued for five years,
studying chiefly Latin and Greek. During this time he frequently
went to Kensington church, in the repairs of which his father was
employed, and the impression he received on hearing the organ
of that church seems to have roused his love for music. The
organist at that time was Henry Whitney, from whom Callcott
received his first musical instruction. He did not, however,
choose music as a profession, as he wished to become a surgeon.
But on witnessing a surgical operation he found his nervous
system so seriously affected by the sight, that he determined to
devote himself to music. His intimacy with Dr Arnold and
other leading musicians of the day procured him access to artistic
circles; he was deputy organist at St George the Martyr, Queen
Square, Bloomsbury, from 1783 to 1785, in which year his successful
competition for three out of the four prize medals offered by
the &ldquo;Catch Club&rdquo; soon spread his reputation as composer of
glees, catches, canons and other pieces of concerted vocal music.
The compositions with which he won these medals were&mdash;the
catch &ldquo;O beauteous fair,&rdquo; the canon &ldquo;Blessed is he,&rdquo; and the
glee &ldquo;Dull repining sons of care.&rdquo; In these and other similar
compositions he displays considerable skill and talent, and some
of his glees retain their popularity at the present day. In 1787
Callcott helped Dr Arnold and others to form the &ldquo;Glee Club.&rdquo;
In 1789 he became one of the two organists at St Paul&rsquo;s, Covent
Garden, and from 1793 to 1802 he was organist to the Asylum for
Female Orphans. As an instrumental composer Callcott never
succeeded, not even after he had taken lessons from Haydn. But
of far greater importance than his compositions are his theoretical
writings. His <i>Musical Grammar</i>, published in 1806 (3rd ed.,
1817), was long considered the standard English work of musical
instruction, and in spite of its being antiquated when compared
with modern standards, it remains a scholarly and lucid treatment
of the rudiments of the art. Callcott was a much-esteemed
teacher of music for many years. In 1800 he took his degree of
Mus.D. at Oxford, where fifteen years earlier he had received his
degree of bachelor of music, and in 1805 he succeeded Dr Crotch
as musical lecturer at the Royal Institution. Towards the end of
his life his artistic career was twice interrupted by the failure of
his mental powers. He died at Bristol after much suffering on
the 15th of May 1821. A posthumous collection of his most
favourite vocal pieces was published in 1824 with a memoir of
his life by his son-in-law, William Horsley, himself a composer
of note.</p>

<p>Callcott&rsquo;s son, <span class="sc">William Hutchins Callcott</span> (1807-1882), inherited
to a large extent the musical gifts of his father. His song,
&ldquo;The last man,&rdquo; and his anthem, &ldquo;Give peace in our time, O
Lord,&rdquo; were his best-known compositions.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALLIAS,<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> tyrant of Chalcis in Euboea. With the assistance
of Philip II. of Macedon, which he hoped to obtain, he contemplated
the subjugation of the whole island. But finding that
Philip was unwilling to help him, Callias had recourse to the
Athenians, although he had previously (350 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) been engaged
in hostilities with them. With the support of Demosthenes, he
was enabled to conclude an alliance with Athens, and the tribute
formerly paid by Eretria and Oreus to Athens was handed over
to him. But his plan of uniting the whole of Euboea under his
rule, with Chalcis as capital, was frustrated by Philip, who set up
tyrants chosen by himself at Eretria and Oreus. Subsequently,
when Philip&rsquo;s attention was engaged upon Thrace, the Athenians
in conjunction with Callias drove out these tyrants, and Callias
thus became master of the island (Demosthenes, <i>De Pace</i>, p. 58;
<i>Epistola Philippi</i>, p. 159; Diod. Sic. xvi. 74). At the end of his
life he appears to have lived at Athens, and Demosthenes proposed
to confer the citizenship upon him (Aeschines, <i>Contra
Ctesiphontem</i>, 85, 87).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALLIAS<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> and <b>HIPPONICUS,</b> two names borne alternately by

During the 5th and 4th centuries <span class="sc">b.c.</span> the office of <i>daduchus</i> or
torch-bearer at the Eleusinian mysteries was the hereditary
privilege of the family till its extinction. The following members
deserve mention.</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Callias</span>, the second of the name, fought at the battle of
Marathon (490) in priestly attire. Some time after the death of
Cimon, probably about 445 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, he was sent to Susa to conclude
with Artaxerxes, king of Persia, a treaty of peace afterwards
misnamed the &ldquo;peace of Cimon.&rdquo; Cimon had nothing to do
with it, and he was totally opposed to the idea of peace with
Persia (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cimon</a></span>). At all events Callias&rsquo;s mission does not
seem to have been successful; he was indicted for high treason
on his return to Athens and sentenced to a fine of fifty talents.</p>

conclusion of any formal treaty; see also Ed. Meyer, <i>Forschungen</i>,
ii.; J.B. Bury in <i>Hermathena</i>, xxiv. (1898).</p>

<p>2. <span class="sc">Hipponicus</span>, son of the above. Together with Eurymedon
he commanded the Athenian forces in the incursion into Boeotian
territory (426 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) and was slain at the battle of Delium (424).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>
His wife, whom he divorced, subsequently became the wife of
Pericles; one of his daughters, Hipparete, married Alcibiades;
another, the wife of Theodorus, was the mother of the orator
Isocrates.</p>

<div class="condensed">

<p>3. <span class="sc">Callias</span>, son of the above, the black sheep of the family, was
notorious for his profligacy and extravagance, and was ridiculed
by the comic poets as an example of a degenerate Athenian
(Aristophanes, <i>Frogs</i>, 429, <i>Birds</i>, 283, and schol. Andocides, <i>De
Mysteriis</i>, 110-131). The scene of Xenophon&rsquo;s <i>Symposium</i> and
Plato&rsquo;s <i>Protagoras</i> was laid at his house. He was reduced to a
state of absolute poverty and, according to Aelian (<i>Var. Hist.</i> iv.
23), committed suicide, but there is no confirmation of this. In
spite of his dissipated life he played a certain part in public
affairs. In 392 he was in command of the Athenian hoplites at
Corinth, when the Spartans were defeated by Iphicrates. In 371
he was at the head of the embassy sent to make terms with Sparta.
The peace which was the result was called after him the &ldquo;peace
of Callias.&rdquo;</p>

inventions, the Corinthian column and the running borer for
drilling marble. The most certain facts in regard to him are that
he sculptured some dancing Laconian maidens, and made a

Alexandria, and some of the most distinguished grammarians

by Ptolemy Philadelphus chief librarian of the Alexandrian
library, which office he held till his death (about 240). His
<i>Pinakes</i> (tablets), in 120 books, a critical and chronologically
arranged catalogue of the library, laid the foundation of a history
of Greek literature. According to Suidas, he wrote about 800
works, in verse and prose; of these only six hymns, sixty-four
epigrams and some fragments are extant; a considerable
fragment of the <i>Hecale</i>, an idyllic epic, has also been discovered
in the Rainer papyri (see Kenyon in <i>Classical Review</i>, November
1893). His <i>Coma Berenices</i> is only known from the celebrated
imitation of Catullus. His <i>Aitia</i> (causes) was a collection of
elegiac poems in four books, dealing with the foundation of
cities, religious ceremonies and other customs. According to
Quintilian (<i>Instit.</i> x. i. 58) he was the chief of the elegiac poets;
his elegies were highly esteemed by the Romans, and imitated by
Ovid, Catullus and especially Propertius. The extant hymns
are extremely learned, and written in a laboured and artificial
style. The epigrams, some of the best specimens of their kind,
have been incorporated in the Greek Anthology. Art and learning
are his chief characteristics, unrelieved by any real poetic
genius; in the words of Ovid (<i>Amores</i>, i. 15)&mdash;</p>

he was appointed to attend Alexander the Great in his Asiatic
expedition. He censured Alexander&rsquo;s adoption of oriental
customs, inveighing especially against the servile ceremony of
adoration. Having thereby greatly offended the king, he was
accused of being privy to a treasonable conspiracy and thrown
into prison, where he died from torture or disease. His melancholy

four Greek versions (two in prose and two in verse) in the middle

at Nancy in Lorraine, where his father, Jean Callot, was a herald-at-arms.
He early discovered a very strong predilection for art,
and at the age of twelve quitted home without his father&rsquo;s
consent, and set out for Rome where he intended to prosecute
his studies. Being utterly destitute of funds he joined a troop of
Bohemians, and arrived in their company at Florence. In this
city he had the good fortune to attract the notice of a gentleman
of the court, who supplied him with the means of study; but he
removed in a short time to Rome, where, however, he was
recognized by some relatives, who immediately compelled him
to return home. Two years after this, and when only fourteen
years old, he again left France contrary to the wishes of his
friends, and reached Turin before he was overtaken by his elder
brother, who had been despatched in quest of him. As his
enthusiasm for art remained undiminished after these disappointments,
he was at last allowed to accompany the duke of Lorraine&rsquo;s
envoy to the papal court. His first care was to study the art of
design, of which in a short time he became a perfect master.
Philip Thomasin instructed him in the use of the graver, which,
however, he ultimately abandoned, substituting the point as
better adapted for his purposes. From Rome he went to Florence,
where he remained till the death of Cosimo II., the Maecenas of
these times. On returning to his native country he was warmly
received by the then duke of Lorraine, who admired and encouraged
him. As his fame was now spread abroad in various
countries of Europe, many distinguished persons gave him
commissions to execute. By the Infanta Isabella, sovereign of
the Low Countries, he was commissioned to engrave a design of
the siege of Breda; and at the request of Louis XIII. he designed
the siege of Rochelle and the attack on the Isle of R√©. When,
however, in 1631 he was desired by that monarch to execute an
engraving of the siege of Nancy, which he had just taken, Callot
refused, saying, &ldquo;I would rather cut off my thumb than do
anything against the honour of my prince and of my country&rdquo;;
to which Louis replied that the duke of Lorraine was happy in
possessing such subjects as Callot. Shortly after this he returned
to his native place, from which the king failed to allure him with
the offer of a handsome pension. He engraved in all about 1600
pieces, the best of which are those executed in aquafortis. No
one ever possessed in a higher degree the talent for grouping a
large number of figures in a small space, and of representing with
two or three bold strokes the expression, action and peculiar
features of each individual. Freedom, variety and <i>naivet√©</i>
characterize all his pieces. His Fairs, his Miseries of War, his
Sieges, his Temptation of St Anthony and his Conversion of St
Paul are the best-known of his plates.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALLOVIAN<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> (from <i>Callovium</i>, the Latinized form of Kellaways,
a village not far from Chippenham in Wiltshire), in geology, the
name introduced by d&rsquo;Orbigny for the strata which constitute
the base of the Oxfordian or lowermost stage of the Middle
Oolites. The term used by d&rsquo;Orbigny in 1844 was &ldquo;Kellovien,&rdquo;
subsequently altered to &ldquo;Callovien&rdquo; in 1849; William Smith
wrote &ldquo;Kellaways&rdquo; or &ldquo;Kelloways Stone&rdquo; towards the close
of the 18th century. In England it is now usual to speak of the
Kellaways Beds; these comprise (1) the Kellaways Rock,
alternating clays and sands with frequent but irregular concretionary
calcareous sandstones, with abundant fossils; and
(2) a lower division, the Kellaways Clay, which often contains
much selenite but is poor in fossils. The lithological characters
are impersistent, and the sandy phase encroaches sometimes
more, sometimes less, upon the true Oxford Clay. The rocks
may be traced from Wiltshire into Bedfordshire, Lincolnshire
and Yorkshire, where they are well exposed in the cliffs at
Scarborough and Gristhorpe, at Hackness (90 ft.), Newtondale
(80 ft.) and Kepwick (100 ft.). In Yorkshire, however, the
Callovian rocks lie upon a somewhat higher palaeontological
horizon than in Wiltshire. In England, <i>Kepplerites calloviensis</i>
is taken as the zone fossil; other common forms are <i>Cosmoceras
modiolare</i>, <i>C. gowerianum</i>, <i>Belemnites oweni</i>, <i>Ancyloceras calloviense</i>,
<i>Nautilus calloviensis</i>, <i>Avicula ovalis</i>, <i>Gryphaea bilobata</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the European continent the &ldquo;Callovien&rdquo; stage is used in a
sense that is not exactly synonymous with the English Callovian;
it is employed to embrace beds that lie both higher and lower in
the time-scale. Thus, the continental Callovien includes the
following zones:&mdash;</p>

<p>Rocks of Callovian age (according to the continental classification)
are widely spread in Europe, which, with the exception of
numerous insular masses, was covered by the Callovian Sea. The
largest of these land areas lay over Scandinavia and Finland,
and extended eastward as far as the 40th meridian. In arctic
regions these rocks have been discovered in Spitzbergen, Franz
Josef Land, the east coast of Greenland, and Siberia. They
occur in the Hebrides and Skye and in England as indicated
above. In France they are well exposed on the coast of Calvados
between Trouville and Dives, where the marls and clays are
200 ft. thick. In the Ardennes clays bearing pyrites and oolitic
limonite are about 30 ft. thick. Around Poitiers the Callovian
is 100 ft. thick, but the formation thins in the direction of the
Jura.</p>

<p>Clays and shales with ferruginous oolites represent the Callovian
of Germany; while in Russia the deposits of this age are mainly
argillaceous. In North America Callovian fossils are found in
California; in South America in Bolivia. In Africa they have
been found in Algeria and Morocco, in Somaliland and Zanzibar,
and on the west coast of Madagascar. In India they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
represented by the shales and limestones of the Chari series of
Cutch. Callovian rocks are also recorded from New Guinea
and the Moluccas.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALM,<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> an adjective meaning peaceful, quiet; particularly
used of the weather, free from wind or storm, or of the sea,
opposed to rough. The word appears in French <i>calme</i>, through
which it came into English, in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian
<i>calma</i>. Most authorities follow Diez (<i>Etym. W√∂rterbuch der
romanischen Sprachen</i>) in tracing the origin to the Low Latin
<i>cauma</i>, an adaptation of Greek <span class="grk" title="kauma">&#954;&#945;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</span>, burning heat, <span class="grk" title="kaiein">&#954;&#945;&#943;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to burn.
The Portuguese <i>calma</i> has this meaning as well as that of quiet.
The connexion would be heat of the day, rest during that period,
so quiet, rest, peacefulness. The insertion of the <i>l</i>, which in
English pronunciation disappears, is probably due to the Latin
<i>calor</i>, heat, with which the word was associated.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALMET, ANTOINE AUGUSTIN<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> (1672-1757), French Benedictine,
was born at Mesnil-la-Horgne on the 26th of February
1672. At the age of seventeen he joined the Benedictine order,
and in 1698 was appointed to teach theology and philosophy at
the abbey of Moyen-Moutier. He was successively prior at Lay,
abbot at Nancy and of S√©nones in Lorraine. He died in Paris
on the 25th of October 1757. The erudition of Calmet&rsquo;s exegetical
writings won him a reputation that was not confined to the
Roman Catholic Church, but they have failed to stand the test
of modern scholarship. The most noteworthy are:&mdash;<i>Commentaire
de la Bible</i> (Paris, 23 vols. 1707-1716), and <i>Dictionnaire historique,
g√©ographique, critique, chronologique et litt√©ral de la Bible</i> (Paris,
2 vols., 1720). These and numerous other works and editions of
the Bible are known only to students, but as a pioneer in a branch
of Biblical study which received a wide development in the
19th century, Calmet is worthy of remembrance. As a historical
writer he is best known by his <i>Histoire eccl√©siastique et
civile de la Lorraine</i> (Nancy, 1728), founded on original research
and various useful works on Lorraine, of which a full list is given

<p><span class="bold">CALNE,<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough in the Chippenham
parliamentary division of Wiltshire, England, 99 m. west
of London by the Great Western railway. Pop. (1901) 3457.
Area, 356 acres. It lies in the valley of the Calne, and is surrounded
by the high table-land of Salisbury Plain and the
Marlborough Downs. The church of St Mark has a nave with
double aisles, and massive late Norman pillars and arches. The
tower, which fell in 1628, was perhaps rebuilt by Inigo Jones.
Other noteworthy buildings are a grammar school, founded by
John Bentley in 1660, and the town-hall. Bacon-curing is the
staple industry, and there are flour, flax and paper mills. The
manufacture of broadcloth, once of great importance, is almost
extinct. Calne is governed by a mayor, four aldermen and
twelve councillors.</p>

<p>In the 10th century Calne (<i>Canna</i>, <i>Kalne</i>) was the site of a
palace of the West-Saxon kings. Calne was the scene of the
synod of 978 when, during the discussion of the question of
celibacy, the floor suddenly gave way beneath the councillors,
leaving Archbishop Dunstan alone standing upon a beam.
Here also a witenagemot was summoned in 997. In the Domesday
Survey Calne appears as a royal borough; it comprised
forty-seven burgesses and was not assessed in hides. In 1565
the borough possessed a gild merchant, at the head of which
were two gild stewards. Calne claimed to have received a charter
from Stephen and a confirmation of the same from Henry III.,
but no record of these is extant, and the charter actually issued
to the borough by James II. in 1687 apparently never came into
force. The borough returned two members to parliament more
or less irregularly from the first parliament of Edward I. until the
Reform Bill of 1832. From this date the borough returned one
member only until, by the Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885, the
privilege was annulled. In 1303 Lodovicus de Bello Monte,
prebendary of Salisbury, obtained a grant of a Saturday market
at the manor of Calne, and a three days&rsquo; fair at the feast of
St Mary Magdalene; the latter was only abandoned in the 19th
century. Calne was formerly one of the chief centres of cloth
manufacture in the west of England, but the industry is extinct.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CALOMEL<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span>, a drug consisting of mercurous chloride, mercury
subchloride, Hg<span class="su">2</span>Cl<span class="su">2</span>, which occurs in nature as the mineral
horn-quicksilver, found as translucent crystals belonging to the
tetragonal system, with an adamantine lustre, and a dirty white
grey or brownish colour. The chief localities are Idria, Obermoschel,
Horowitz in Bavaria and Almaden in Spain. It was
used in medicine as early as the 16th century under the names
<i>Draco mitigatus, Manna metallorum, Aquila alba, Mercurius dulcis</i>;
later it became known as calomel, a name probably derived
from the Greek <span class="grk" title="kalos">&#954;&#945;&#955;&#972;&#962;</span>, beautiful, and <span class="grk" title="melas">&#956;&#941;&#955;&#945;&#962;</span>, black, in allusion
to its blackening by ammonia, or from <span class="grk" title="kalos">&#954;&#945;&#955;&#972;&#962;</span> and <span class="grk" title="meli">&#956;&#941;&#955;&#953;</span>, honey,
from its sweet taste. It may be obtained by heating mercury in
chlorine, or by reducing mercuric chloride (corrosive sublimate)
with mercury or sulphurous acid. It is manufactured by heating
a mixture of mercurous sulphate and common salt in iron
retorts, and condensing the sublimed calomel in brick chambers.
In the wet way it is obtained by precipitating a mercurous salt
with hydrochloric acid. Calomel is a white powder which
sublimes at a low red heat; it is insoluble in water, alcohol and
ether. Boiling with stannous chloride solution reduces it to
the metal; digestion with potassium iodide gives mercurous
iodide. Nitric acid oxidizes it to mercuric nitrate, while
potash or soda decomposes it into mercury and oxygen. Long
continued boiling with water gives mercury and mercuric
chloride; dilute hydrochloric acid or solutions of alkaline
chlorides convert it into mercuric chloride on long boiling.</p>

<p>The molecular weight of mercurous chloride has given occasion
for much discussion. E. Mitscherlich determined the vapour
density to be 8.3 (air = 1), corresponding to HgCl. The supporters
of the formula Hg<span class="su">2</span>Cl<span class="su">2</span> pointed out that dissociation into mercury
and mercuric chloride would give this value, since mercury is a
monatomic element. After contradictory evidence as to whether
dissociation did or did not occur, it was finally shown by Victor
Meyer and W. Harris (1894) that a rod moistened with potash
and inserted in the vapour was coloured yellow, and so conclusively
proved dissociation. A. Werner determined the molecular
weights of mercurous, cuprous and silver bromides, iodides
and chlorides in pyridine solution, and obtained results pointing
to the formula HgCl, etc. However, the double formula,
Hg<span class="su">2</span>Cl<span class="su">2</span>, has been completely established by H.B. Baker (<i>Journ.
Chem. Soc.</i>, 1900, 77, p. 646) by vapour density determinations
of the absolutely dry substance.</p>

<p>Calomel possesses certain special properties and uses in
medicine which are dealt with here as a supplement to the
general discussion of the pharmacology and therapeutics of
mercury (<i>q.v.</i>). Calomel exerts remote actions in the form of
mercuric chloride. The specific value of mercurous chloride is
that it exerts the valuable properties of mercuric chloride in the
safest and least irritant manner, as the active salt is continuously
and freshly generated in small quantities. Its pharmacopeial
preparations are the &ldquo;Black wash,&rdquo; in which calomel and lime
react to form mercurous oxide, a pill still known as &ldquo;Plummer&rsquo;s
pill&rdquo; and an ointment. Externally the salt has not any particular
advantage over other mercurial compounds, despite the
existence of the official ointment. Internally the salt is given in
doses&mdash;for an adult of from one-half to five grains. It is an
admirable aperient, acting especially on the upper part of the
intestinal canal, and causing a slight increase of intestinal
secretion. The stimulant action occurring high up in the canal
(duodenum and jejunum), it is well to follow a dose of calomel
with a saline purgative a few hours afterwards. The special
value of the drug as an aperient depends on its antiseptic power
and its stimulation of the liver. The stools are dark green,
containing calomel, mercuric sulphide and bile which, owing to
the antiseptic action, has not been decomposed. The salt is often
used in the treatment of syphilis, but is probably less useful than
certain other mercurial compounds. It is also employed for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
fumigation; the patient sits naked with a blanket over him, on a
cane-bottomed chair, under which twenty grains of calomel are
volatilized by a spirit-lamp; in about twenty minutes the
calomel is effectually absorbed by the skin.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALONNE, CHARLES ALEXANDRE DE<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> (1734-1803), French
statesman, was born at Douai of a good family. He entered the
profession of the law, and became in succession advocate to the
general council of Artois, <i>procureur</i> to the parlement of Douai,
master of requests, then intendant of Metz (1768) and of Lille
(1774). He seems to have been a man of great business capacity,
gay and careless in temperament, and thoroughly unscrupulous
in political action. In the terrible crisis of affairs preceding the
French Revolution, when minister after minister tried in vain
to replenish the exhausted royal treasury and was dismissed for
want of success, Calonne was summoned to take the general
control of affairs. He assumed office on the 3rd of November
1783. He owed the position to Vergennes, who for three years
and a half continued to support him; but the king was not well
disposed towards him, and, according to the testimony of the
Austrian ambassador, his reputation with the public was extremely
poor. In taking office he found &ldquo;600 millions to pay
and neither money nor credit.&rdquo; At first he attempted to
develop the latter, and to carry on the government by means of
loans in such a way as to maintain public confidence in its
solvency. In October 1785 he recoined the gold coinage, and he
developed the <i>caisse d&rsquo; escompte</i>. But these measures failing, he
proposed to the king the suppression of internal customs, duties
and the taxation of the property of nobles and clergy. Turgot
and Necker had attempted these reforms, and Calonne attributed
their failure to the malevolent criticism of the parlements.
Therefore he had an assembly of &ldquo;notables&rdquo; called together in
January 1787. Before it he exposed the deficit in the treasury,
and proposed the establishment of a <i>subvention territoriale</i>,
which should be levied on all property without distinction. This
suppression of privileges was badly received by the privileged
notables. Calonne, angered, printed his reports and so alienated
the court. Louis XVI. dismissed him on the 8th of April 1787
and exiled him to Lorraine. The joy was general in Paris, where
Calonne, accused of wishing to augment the imposts, was known
as &ldquo;Monsieur Deficit.&rdquo; In reality his audacious plan of reforms,
which Necker took up later, might have saved the monarchy had
it been firmly seconded by the king. Calonne soon afterwards
passed over to England, and during his residence there kept up a
polemical correspondence with Necker on the finances. In 1789,
when the states-general were about to assemble, he crossed over
to Flanders in the hope of being allowed to offer himself for
election, but he was sternly forbidden to enter France. In
revenge he joined the <i>√©migr√©</i> party at Coblenz, wrote in their
favour, and expended nearly all the fortune brought him by his
wife, a wealthy widow. In 1802, having again taken up his abode
in London, he received permission from Napoleon to return to
France. He died on the 30th of October 1802, about a month
after his arrival in his native country.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALORESCENCE<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> (from the Lat. <i>calor</i>, heat), a term invented
by John Tyndall to describe an optical phenomenon, the essential
feature of which is the conversion of rays belonging to the dark
infra-red portion of the spectrum into the more refrangible visible
rays, <i>i.e.</i> heat rays into rays of light. Such a transformation
had not previously been observed, although the converse phenomenon,
<i>i.e.</i> the conversion of short waves of light into longer or
less refrangible waves, had been shown by Sir G.G. Stokes to
occur in fluorescent bodies. Tyndall&rsquo;s experiments, however,
were carried out on quite different lines, and have nothing to do
with fluorescence (<i>q.v.</i>). His method was to sift out the long
dark waves which are associated with the short visible waves
constituting the light of the sun or of the electric arc and to
concentrate the former to a focus. If the eye was placed at the
focus, no sensation of light was observed, although small pieces
of charcoal or blackened platinum foil were immediately raised
to incandescence, thus giving rise to visible rays.</p>

<p>The experiment is more easily carried out with the electric
light than with sunlight, as the former contains a smaller proportion
of visible rays. According to Tyndall, 90% of the
radiation from the electric arc is non-luminous. The arc being
struck in the usual way between two carbons, a concave mirror,
placed close behind it, caused a large part of the radiation to be
directed through an aperture in the camera and concentrated to
a focus outside. In front of the aperture were placed a plate of
transparent rock-salt, and a flat cell of thin glass containing a
solution of iodine in carbon bisulphide. Both rock-salt and
carbon bisulphide are extremely transparent to the luminous
and also to the infra-red rays The iodine in the solution,
however, has the property of absorbing the luminous rays, while
transmitting the infra-red rays copiously, so that in sufficient
thicknesses the solution appears nearly black. Owing to the
inflammable nature of carbon bisulphide, the plate of rock-salt
was found to be hardly a sufficient protection, and Tyndall
surrounded the iodine cell with an annular vessel through which
cold water was made to flow. Any small body which was a good
absorber of dark rays was rapidly heated to redness when placed
at the focus. Platinized platinum (platinum foil upon which a
thin film of platinum had been deposited electrolytically) and
charcoal were rendered incandescent, black paper and matches
immediately inflamed, ordinary brown paper pierced and
burned, while thin white blotting-paper, owing to its transparency
to the invisible rays, was scarcely tinged. A simpler arrangement,
also employed by Tyndall, is to cause the rays to be reflected
outwards parallel to one another, and to concentrate them
by means of a small flask, containing the iodine solution and used
as a lens, placed some distance from the camera. The rock-salt
and cold water circulation can then be dispensed with.</p>

<p>Since the rays used by Tyndall in these experiments are similar
to those emitted by a heated body which is not hot enough to be
luminous, it might be thought that the radiation, say from a hot
kettle, could be concentrated to a focus and employed to render
a small body luminous. It would, however, be impossible by such
means to raise the receiving body to a higher temperature than
the source of radiation. For it is easy to see that if, by means of
lenses of rock-salt or mirrors, we focused all or nearly all the rays
from a small surface on to another surface of equal area, this
would not raise the temperature of the second surface above that
of the first; and we could not obtain a greater concentration of
rays from a large heated surface, since we could not have all parts
of the surface simultaneously in focus. The desired result could
be obtained if it were possible, by reflection or otherwise, to cause
two different rays to unite without loss and pursue a common
path. Such a result must be regarded as impossible of attainment,
as it would imply the possibility of heat passing from one
body to another at a higher temperature, contrary to the second
law of thermodynamics (<i>q.v.</i>). Tyndall used the dark rays from
a luminous source, which are emitted in a highly concentrated
form, so that it was possible to obtain a high temperature, which
was, however, much lower than that of the source.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALORIMETRY<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span>, the scientific name for the measurement of
quantities of heat (Lat. <i>calor</i>), to be distinguished from thermometry,
which signifies the measurement of temperature. A
calorimeter is any piece of apparatus in which heat is measured.
This distinction of meaning is purely a matter of convention, but
it is very rigidly observed. Quantities of heat may be measured
indirectly in a variety of ways in terms of the different effects of
heat on material substances. The most important of these
effects are (<i>a</i>) rise of temperature, (<i>b</i>) change of state, (<i>c</i>) transformation
of energy.</p>

<p>¬ß 1. The rise of temperature of a body, when heat is imparted
to it, is found to be in general nearly proportional to the quantity
of heat added. The <i>thermal capacity</i> of a body is measured by
the quantity of heat required to raise its temperature one degree,
and is necessarily proportional to the mass of the body for bodies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
of the same substance under similar conditions. The <i>specific
heat</i> of a substance is sometimes defined as the thermal capacity
of unit mass, but more often as the ratio of the thermal capacity
of unit mass of the substance to that of unit mass of water at
some standard temperature. The two definitions are identical,
provided that the thermal capacity of unit mass of water, at a
standard temperature, is taken as the unit of heat. But the
specific heat of water is often stated in terms of other units. In
any case it is necessary to specify the temperature, and sometimes
also the pressure, since the specific heat of a substance generally
depends to some extent on the external conditions. The methods
of measurement, founded on rise of temperature, may be classed
as <i>thermometric methods,</i> since they depend on the observation of
change of temperature with a thermometer. The most familiar
of these are the method of mixture and the method of cooling.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>¬ß 2. The <i>Method of Mixture</i> consists in imparting the quantity
of heat to be measured to a known mass of water, or some other
standard substance, contained in a vessel or calorimeter of known
thermal capacity, and in observing the rise of temperature produced,
from which data the quantity of heat may be found as
explained in all elementary text-books. This method is the most
generally convenient and most readily applicable of calorimetric
methods, but it is not always the most accurate, for various reasons.
Some heat is generally lost in transferring the heated body to the
calorimeter; this loss may be minimized by performing the transference
rapidly, but it cannot be accurately calculated or eliminated.
Some heat is lost when the calorimeter is raised above the temperature
of its enclosure, and before the final temperature is reached.
This can be roughly estimated by observing the rate of change of
temperature before and after the experiment, and assuming that the
loss of heat is directly proportional to the duration of the experiment
and to the average excess of temperature. It can be minimized by
making the mixing as rapid as possible, and by using a large calorimeter,
so that the excess of temperature is always small. The latter
method was generally adopted by J.P. Joule, but the rise of temperature
is then difficult to measure with accuracy, since it is necessarily
reduced in nearly the same proportion as the correction.
There is, however, the advantage that the correction is rendered
much less uncertain by this procedure, since the assumption that
the loss of heat is proportional to the temperature-excess is only
true for small differences of temperature. Rumford proposed to
eliminate this correction by starting with the initial temperature
of the calorimeter as much below that of its enclosure as the final
temperature was expected to be above the same limit. This method
has been very generally recommended, but it is really bad, because,
although it diminishes the absolute magnitude of the correction,
it greatly increases the uncertainty of it and therefore the probable
error of the result. The coefficient of heating of a calorimeter when
it is below the temperature of its surroundings is seldom, if ever, the
same as the coefficient of cooling at the higher temperature, since
the convection currents, which do most of the heating or cooling, are
rarely symmetrical in the two cases, and moreover, the duration
of the two stages is seldom the same. In any case, it is desirable to
diminish the loss of heat as much as possible by polishing the exterior
of the calorimeter to diminish radiation, and by suspending it by
non-conducting supports, inside a polished case, to protect it from
draughts. It is also very important to keep the surrounding conditions
as constant as possible throughout the experiment. This may
be secured by using a large water-bath to surround the apparatus,
but in experiments of long duration it is necessary to use an accurate
temperature regulator. The method of lagging the calorimeter with
cotton-wool or other non-conductors, which is often recommended,
diminishes the loss of heat considerably, but renders it very uncertain
and variable, and should never be used in work of precision. The bad
conductors take so long to reach a steady state that the rate of loss
of heat at any moment depends on the past history more than on
the temperature of the calorimeter at the moment. A more serious
objection to the use of lagging of this kind is the danger of its absorbing
moisture. The least trace of damp in the lagging, or of moisture
condensed on the surface of the calorimeter, may produce serious
loss of heat by evaporation. This is another objection to Rumford&rsquo;s
method of cooling the calorimeter below the surrounding temperature
before starting. Among minor difficulties of the method may be
mentioned the uncertainty of the thermal capacity of the calorimeter
and stirrer, and of the immersed portion of the thermometer. This
is generally calculated by assuming values for the specific heats of
the materials obtained by experiment between 100¬∞ C. and 20¬∞ C.
Since the specific heats of most metals increase rapidly with rise of
temperature, the values so obtained are generally too high. It is
best to make this correction as small as possible by using a large
calorimeter, so that the mass of water is large in proportion to that
of metal. Analogous difficulties arise in the application of other
calorimetric methods. The accuracy of the work in each case
depends principally on the skill and ingenuity of the experimentalist
in devising methods of eliminating the various sources of error.
The form of apparatus usually adopted for the method of mixtures
is that of Regnault with slight modifications, and figures and descriptions
are given in all the text-books. Among special methods
which have been subsequently developed there are two which deserve
mention as differing in principle from the common type. These
are (1) the constant temperature method, (2) the continuous flow
method.</p>

<p>The <i>constant temperature method of mixtures</i> was proposed by
N. Hesehus (<i>Jour. Phys.</i>, 1888, vii. p. 489). Cold water at a known
temperature is added to the calorimeter, immediately after dropping
in the heated substance, at such a rate as to keep the temperature
of the calorimeter constant, thus eliminating the corrections for
the water equivalent of the calorimeter and the external loss of heat.
The calorimeter is surrounded by an air-jacket connected to a
petroleum gauge which indicates any small change of temperature
in the calorimeter, and enables the manipulator to adjust the supply
of cold water to compensate it. The apparatus as arranged by
F.A. Waterman is shown in fig. 1 (<i>Physical Review,</i> 1896, iv. p. 161).
A is the calorimetric tube,
B the air-jacket and L
the gauge. H is an electric
heater for raising the body
to a suitable temperature,
which can swing into place
directly over the calorimeter.
W is a conical can
containing water cooled
by ice I nearly to 0¬∞, which
is swung over the calorimeter
as soon as the hot
body has been introduced
and the heater removed.
The cold water flow is
regulated by a tap S with
a long handle O, and its
temperature is taken by a
delicate thermometer with
its bulb at G. The method
is interesting, but the
manipulations and observations
involved are more
troublesome than with the
ordinary type of calorimeter,
and it may be
doubted whether any advantage
is gained in
accuracy.</p>

<p>The <i>continuous flow
method</i> is specially applicable
to the important case
of calorific value of gaseous
fuel, where a large quantity
of heat is continuously
generated at a
nearly uniform rate by combustion. Fig. 2 illustrates a recent
type of gas calorimeter devised by C.V. Boys (<i>Proc. R.S.,</i> 1906,
A. 77, p. 122). The heated products of combustion from the burner
B impinge on a metal box H, through which water is circulating, and
then pass downwards and outwards through a spiral cooler which reduces
them practically to the atmospheric temperature. A steady
stream of water enters the apparatus by the inflow thermometer O,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span>
flows through the spiral coolers N and M, and finally through the box
H, where it is well mixed before passing the outflow thermometer P.
As soon as a steady state is reached, the difference of temperature
between the outflow and inflow thermometers, multiplied by the
current of water in grammes per minute gives the heat per minute
supplied by combustion. The gas current is simultaneously observed
by a suitable meter, which, with subsidiary corrections for
pressure, temperature, &amp;c., gives the necessary data for deducing
calorific value.</p>

<p>A continuous flow calorimeter has been used by the writer for
measuring quantities of heat conveyed by conduction (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Conduction
of Heat</a></span>), and also for determining the variation of the
specific heat of water. In the latter case two steady currents of water
at different temperatures, say 0¬∞ and 100¬∞ are passed through an
equalizer, and the resulting temperature measured without mixing
the currents, which are then separately determined by weighing.
This is a very good method of comparing the mean specific heats
over two ranges of temperature such as 0-50, and 50-100, or 0-20
and 20-40, but it is not so suitable as the electric method described
below for obtaining the actual specific heat at any point of the
range.</p>
</div>

<p>¬ß 3. <i>Method of Cooling.</i>&mdash;A common example of this method
is the determination of the specific heat of a liquid by filling a
small calorimeter with the liquid, raising it to a convenient
temperature, and then setting it to cool in an enclosure at a
steady temperature, and observing the time taken to fall through
a given range when the conditions have become fairly steady.
The same calorimeter is afterwards filled with a known liquid,
such as water, and the time of cooling is observed through the
same range of temperature, in the same enclosure, under the
same conditions. The ratio of the times of cooling is equal to the
ratio of the thermal capacities of the calorimeter and its contents
in the two cases. The advantage of the method is that there is
no transference or mixture; the defect is that the whole measurement
depends on the assumption that the rate of loss of heat is
the same in the two cases, and that any variation in the conditions,
or uncertainty in the rate of loss, produces its full effect
in the result, whereas in the previous case it would only affect a
small correction. Other sources of uncertainty are, that the rate
of loss of heat generally depends to some extent on the rate of
fall of temperature, and that it is difficult to take accurate
observations on a rapidly falling thermometer. As the method
is usually practised, the calorimeter is made very small, and the
surface is highly polished to diminish radiation. It is better to
use a fairly large calorimeter to diminish the rate of cooling and
the uncertainty of the correction for the water equivalent. The
surface of the calorimeter and the enclosure should be permanently
blackened so as to increase the loss of heat by radiation as
much as possible, as compared with the losses by convection and
conduction, which are less regular. For accurate work it is
essential that the liquid in the calorimeter should be continuously
stirred, and also in the enclosure, the lid of which must be water-jacketed,
and kept at the same steady temperature as the sides.
When all these precautions are taken, the method loses most of
the simplicity which is its chief advantage. It cannot be satisfactorily
applied to the case of solids or powders, and is much
less generally useful than the method of mixture.</p>

<p>¬ß 4. <i>Method of Fusion.</i>&mdash;The methods depending on change of
state are theoretically the simplest, since they do not necessarily
involve any reference to thermometry, and the corrections for
external loss of heat and for the thermal capacity of the containing
vessels can be completely eliminated. They nevertheless
present peculiar difficulties and limitations, which render their
practical application more troublesome and more uncertain than
is usually supposed. They depend on the experimental fact that
the quantity of heat required to produce a given change of state
(<i>e.g.</i> to convert one gramme of ice at 0¬∞ C. into water at 0¬∞ C., or
one gramme of water at 100¬∞ C. into steam at 100¬∞ C.) is always
the same, and that there need be no change of temperature during
the process. The difficulties arise in connexion with the determination
of the quantities of ice melted or steam condensed, and
in measuring the latent heat of fusion or vaporization in terms of
other units for the comparison of observations. The earlier forms
of ice-calorimeter, those of Black, and of Laplace and Lavoisier,
were useless for work of precision, on account of the impossibility
of accurately estimating the quantity of water left adhering to
the ice in each case. This difficulty was overcome by the invention
of the Bunsen calorimeter, in which the quantity of ice
melted is measured by observing the diminution of volume, but
the successful employment of this instrument requires considerable
skill in manipulation. The sheath of ice surrounding the
bulb must be sufficiently continuous to prevent escape of heat,
but it must not be so solid as to produce risk of strain. The
ideal condition is difficult to secure. In the practical use of the
instrument it is not necessary to know both the latent heat of
fusion of ice and the change of volume which occurs on melting;
it is sufficient to determine the change of volume per calorie, or
the quantity of mercury which is drawn into the bulb of the
apparatus per unit of heat added. This can be determined by a
direct calibration, by inserting a known quantity of water at a
known temperature and observing the contraction, or weighing
the mercury drawn into the apparatus. In order to be independent
of the accuracy of the thermometer employed for
observing the initial temperature of the water introduced, it
has been usual to employ water at 100¬∞ C., adopting as unit of
heat the &ldquo;mean calorie,&rdquo; which is one-hundredth part of the heat
given up by one gramme of water in cooling from 100¬∞ to 0¬∞ C.
The weight of mercury corresponding to the mean calorie has
been determined with considerable care by a number of observers
well skilled in the use of the instrument. The following are some
of their results:&mdash;Bunsen, 15.41 mgm.; Velten, 15.47 mgm.;
Zakrevski, 15.57 mgm.; Staub, 15.26 mgm. The explanation of
these discrepancies in the fundamental constant is not at all
clear, but they may be taken as an illustration of the difficulties
of manipulation attending the use of this instrument, to which
reference has already been made. It is not possible to deduce a
more satisfactory value from the latent heat and the change of
density, because these constants are very difficult to determine.
The following are some of the values deduced by well-known
experimentalists for the latent heat of fusion:&mdash;Regnault, 79.06
to 79.24 calories, corrected by Person to 79.43; Person, 79.99
calories; Hess, 80.34 calories; Bunsen, 80.025 calories. Regnault,
Person and Hess employed the method of mixture which is
probably the most accurate for the purpose. Person and Hess
avoided the error of water sticking to the ice by using dry ice at
various temperatures below 0¬∞ C., and determining the specific
heat of ice as well as the latent heat of fusion. These discrepancies
might, no doubt, be partly explained by differences in the
units employed, which are somewhat uncertain, as the specific
heat of water changes rapidly in the neighbourhood of 0¬∞ C; but
making all due allowance for this, it remains evident that the
method of ice-calorimetry, in spite of its theoretical simplicity,
presents grave difficulties in its practical application.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>One of the chief difficulties in the practical use of the Bunsen
calorimeter is the continued and often irregular movement of the
mercury column due to slight differences of temperature, or pressure
between the ice in the calorimeter and the ice
bath in which it is immersed. C.V. Boys
(<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1887, vol. 24, p. 214) showed that
these effects could be very greatly reduced by
surrounding the calorimeter with an outer tube,
so that the ice inside was separated from the
ice outside by an air space which greatly
reduces the free passage of heat. The present
writer has found that very good results may be
obtained by enclosing the calorimeter in a
vacuum jacket (as illustrated in fig. 3), which
practically eliminates conduction and convection.
If the vacuum jacket is silvered inside,
radiation also is reduced to such an extent
that, if the vacuum is really good, the external
ice bath may be dispensed with for the majority
of purposes. If the inner bulb is filled with
mercury instead of water and ice, the same
arrangement answers admirably as a Favre
and Silbermann calorimeter, for measuring
small quantities of heat by the expansion of
the mercury.</p>

<p>The question has been raised by E.L. Nichols (<i>Phys. Rev.</i> vol. 8,
January 1899) whether there may not be different modifications of
ice with different densities, and different values of the latent heat
of fusion. He found for natural pond-ice a density 0.9179 and for
artificial ice 0.9161. J. Vincent (<i>Phil. Trans.</i> A. 198, p. 463) also
found a density .9160 for artificial ice, which is probably very nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span>
correct. If such variations of density exist, they may introduce
some uncertainty in the absolute values of results obtained with the
ice calorimeter, and may account for some of the discrepancies above
enumerated.</p>
</div>

<p>¬ß 5. The <i>Method of Condensation</i> was first successfully applied
by J. Joly in the construction of his steam calorimeter, a full
description of which will be found in text-books. The body to be
tested is placed in a special scale-pan, suspended by a fine wire
from the arm of a balance inside an enclosure which can be filled
with steam at atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the
enclosure is carefully observed before admitting steam. The
weight of steam condensed on the body gives a means of calculating
the quantity of heat required to raise it from the atmospheric
temperature up to 100¬∞ C. in terms of the latent heat of vaporization
of steam at 100¬∞ C. There can be no appreciable gain or
loss of heat by radiation, if the admission of the steam is
sufficiently rapid, since the walls of the enclosure are maintained
at 100¬∞ C., very nearly. The thermal capacity of the scale-pan,
&amp;c., can be determined by a separate experiment, or, still better,
eliminated by the differential method of counterpoising with an
exactly similar arrangement on the other arm of the balance.
The method requires very delicate weighing, as one calorie
corresponds to less than two milligrammes of steam condensed;
but the successful application of the method to the very difficult
problem of measuring the specific heat of a gas at constant
volume, shows that these and other difficulties have been very
skilfully overcome. The application of the method appears to be
practically limited to the measurements of specific heat between
the atmospheric temperature and 100¬∞ C. The results depend on
the value assumed for the latent heat of steam, which Joly takes
as 536.7 calories, following Regnault. Joly has himself determined
the mean specific heat of water between 12¬∞ and 100¬∞ C.
by this method, in terms of the latent heat of steam as above
given, and finds the result .9952. Assuming that the mean
specific heat of water between 12¬∞ and 100¬∞ is really 1.0011 in
terms of the calorie at 20¬∞ C. (see table, p. 66), the value of the
latent heat of steam at 100¬∞ C., as determined by Joly, would be
540.2 in terms of the same unit. The calorie employed by
Regnault is to some extent uncertain, but the difference is hardly
beyond the probable errors of experiment, since it appears from
the results of recent experiments that Regnault made an error
of the same order in his determination of the specific heat of
water at 100¬∞ C.</p>

<p>¬ß 6. <i>Energy Methods.</i>&mdash;The third general method of calorimetry,
that based on the transformation of some other kind of energy
into the form of heat, rests on the general principle of the conservation
of energy, and on the experimental fact that all other
forms of energy are readily and completely convertible into the
form of heat. It is therefore often possible to measure quantities
of heat indirectly, by measuring the energy in some other form
and then converting it into heat. In addition to its great
theoretical interest, this method possesses the advantage of
being frequently the most accurate in practical application, since
energy can be more accurately measured in other forms than in
that of heat. The two most important varieties of the method are
(<i>a</i>) mechanical, and (<i>b</i>) electrical. These methods have reached
their highest development in connexion with the determination of
the mechanical equivalent of heat, but they may be applied with
great advantage in connexion with other problems, such as the
measurement of the variation of specific heat, or of latent heats
of fusion or vaporization.</p>

<p>¬ß 7. <i>Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.</i>&mdash;The phrase &ldquo;mechanical
equivalent of heat&rdquo; is somewhat vague, but has been sanctioned
by long usage. It is generally employed to denote the number
of units of mechanical work or energy which, when completely
converted into heat without loss, would be required to produce
one heat unit. The numerical value of the mechanical equivalent
necessarily depends on the particular units of heat and work
employed in the comparison. The British engineer prefers to
state results in terms of foot-pounds of work in any convenient
latitude per pound-degree-Fahrenheit of heat. The continental
engineer prefers kilogrammetres per kilogramme-degree-centigrade.
For scientific use the C.G.S. system of expression in ergs
per gramme-degree-centigrade, or &ldquo;calorie,&rdquo; is the most appropriate,
as being independent of the value of gravity. A more
convenient unit of work or energy, in practice, on account of the
smallness of the erg, is the <i>joule,</i> which is equal to 10.7 ergs, or one
<i>watt-second</i> of electrical energy. On account of its practical
convenience, and its close relation to the international electrical
units, the <i>joule</i> has been recommended by the British Association
for adoption as the absolute unit of heat. Other convenient
practical units of the same kind would be the <i>watt-hour,</i> 3600
joules, which is of the same order of magnitude as the kilo-calorie,
and the <i>kilowatt-hour,</i> which is the ordinary commercial
unit of electrical energy.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>¬ß 8. <i>Joule</i>.&mdash;The earlier work of Joule is now chiefly of historical
interest, but his later measurements in 1878, which were undertaken
on a larger scale, adopting G.A.
Hirn&rsquo;s method of measuring
the work expended in terms of
the torque and the number of
revolutions, still possess
value as experimental evidence.
In these experiments (see fig. 4)
the paddles were revolved by
hand at such a speed as to
produce a constant torque on
the calorimeter <i>h</i>, which was
supported on a float <i>w</i> in a
vessel of water <i>v</i>, but was kept
at rest by the couple due to a
pair of equal weights <i>k</i> suspended
from fine strings passing
round the circumference of
a horizontal wheel attached to
the calorimeter. Each experiment
lasted about forty
minutes, and the rise of temperature
produced was nearly
3¬∞ C. The calorimeter contained
about 5 kilogrammes
of water, so that the rate
of heat-supply was about 6
calories per second. Joule&rsquo;s
final result was 772.55 foot-pounds at Manchester per pound-degree-Fahrenheit
at a temperature of 62¬∞ F., but individual experiments
differed by as much as 1%. This result in C.G.S. measure is equivalent
to 4.177 joules per calorie at 16.5¬∞ C., on the scale of Joule&rsquo;s
mercury thermometer. His thermometers were subsequently corrected
to the Paris scale by A. Schuster in 1895, which had the effect
of reducing the above figure to 4.173.</p>

<p>¬ß 9. <i>Rowland</i>.&mdash;About the same time H.A. Rowland (<i>Proc. Amer.
Acad.</i> xv. p. 75, 1880) repeated the experiment, employing the same
method, but using a larger calorimeter (about 8400 grammes) and
a petroleum motor, so as to obtain a greater rate of heating (about
84 calories per second), and to reduce the importance of the uncertain
correction for external loss of heat. Rowland&rsquo;s apparatus
is shown in fig. 5. The calorimeter was suspended by a steel wire,
the torsion of which made the equilibrium stable. The torque was
measured by weights O and P suspended by silk ribbons passing
over the pulleys <i>n</i> and round the disk <i>kl</i>. The power was transmitted
to the paddles by bevel wheels, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, rotating a spindle passing through
a stuffing box in the bottom of the calorimeter. The number of
revolutions and the rise of temperature were recorded on a chronograph
drum. He paid greater attention to the important question
of thermometry, and extended his researches over a much wider
range of temperature, namely 5¬∞ to 35¬∞ C. His experiments revealed
for the first time a diminution in the specific heat of water with rise
of temperature between 0¬∞ and 30¬∞ C., amounting to four parts in
10.000 per 1¬∞ C. His thermometers were compared with a mercury
thermometer standardized in Paris, and with a platinum thermometer
standardized by Griffiths. The result was to reduce the coefficient
of diminution of specific heat at 15¬∞ C. by nearly one half,
but the absolute value at 20¬∞ C. is practically unchanged. Thus
corrected his values are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">These are expressed in terms of the hydrogen scale, but the difference
from the nitrogen scale is so small as to be within the limits of experimental
error in this particular case. Rowland himself considered
his results to be probably correct to one part in 500, and supposed
that the greatest uncertainty lay in the comparison of the scale of
his mercury thermometer with the air thermometer. The subsequent
correction, though not carried out strictly under the conditions of
the experiment, showed that the order of accuracy of his work about
the middle of the range from 15¬∞ to 25¬∞ was at least 1 in 1000, and
probably 1 in 2000. At 30¬∞ he considered that, owing to the increasing
magnitude and uncertainty of the radiation correction, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
&ldquo;might be a small error in the direction of making the equivalent
too great, and that the specific heat might go on decreasing to even
40¬∞ C.&rdquo; The results considered with reference to the variation of
the specific heat of water are shown in the curve marked Rowland
in Fig. 6.</p>

<p>¬ß 10. <i>Osborne Reynolds and W.H. Moorby (Phil. Trans.,</i> 1897, p. 381)
determined the mechanical equivalent of the mean thermal unit
between 0¬∞ and 100¬∞ C., on a very large scale, with a Froude-Reynolds
hydraulic brake and a steam-engine of 100 h.p. This brake is practically
a Joule calorimeter, ingeniously designed to churn the water
in such a manner as to develop the greatest possible resistance.
The admission of water at 0¬∞ C. to the brake was controlled by hand
in such a manner as to keep the outflow nearly at the boiling-point,
the quantity of water in the brake required to produce a constant
torque being regulated automatically, as the speed varied, by a valve
worked by the lifting of the weighted lever attached to the brake.</p>

<p>The accompanying illustration (fig. 7) shows the brake lagged with
cotton-wool, and the 4-ft. lever to which the weights are suspended.
The power of the brake may be estimated by comparison with the
size of the rope pulley seen behind it on the same shaft. With
300 pounds on a 4-ft. lever at 300 revolutions per minute, the rate of
generation of heat was about 12 kilo-calories per second. In spite
of the large range of temperature, the correction for external loss
of heat amounted to only 5%, with the brake uncovered, and was
reduced to less than 2% by lagging. This is the special advantage
of working on so large a scale with so rapid a generation of heat.
But, for the same reason, the method necessarily presents peculiar
difficulties, which were not overcome without great pains and ingenuity.
The principal troubles arose from damp in the lagging
which necessitated the rejection of several trials, and from dissolved
air in the water, causing loss of heat by the formation of steam.
Next to the radiation loss, the most uncertain correction was that
for conduction of heat along the 4-in. shaft. These losses were as
far as possible eliminated by combining the trials in pairs, with different
loads on the brake, assuming that the heat-loss would be the same
in the heavy and light trials, provided that the external temperature
and the gradient in the shaft, as estimated from the temperature
of the bearings, were the same. The values deduced in this manner
for the equivalent agreed as closely as could be expected considering
the impossibility of regulating the external condition of temperature
and moisture with any certainty in an engine-room. The extreme
variation of results in any one series was only from 776.63 to 779.46
ft.-pounds, or less than ¬Ω%. This variation may have been due
to the state of the lagging, which Moorby distrusted in spite of the
great reduction of the heat-loss, or it may have been partly due to
the difficulty of regulating the speed of the engine and the water-supply
to the brake in such a manner as to maintain a constant
temperature in the outflow, and avoid variations in the heat capacity
of the brake. Since hand regulation is necessarily discontinuous,
the speed and the temperature were constantly varying, so that it
was useless to take readings nearer than the tenth of a degree. The
largest variation recorded in the two trials of which full details are
given, was 4-9¬∞ F. in two minutes in the outflow temperature, and
four or five revolutions per minute on the speed. These variations, so
far as they were of a purely accidental nature, would be approximately
eliminated on the mean of a large number of trials, so that
the accuracy of the final result would be of a higher order than might
be inferred from a comparison of separate pairs of trials. Great pains
were taken to discuss and eliminate all the sources of constant error
which could be foreseen. The results of the light trials with 400 ft.-pounds
on the brake differ slightly from those with 600 ft.-pounds.
This might be merely accidental, or it might indicate some constant
difference in the conditions requiring further investigation. It would
have been desirable, if possible, to have tried the effect of a larger
range of variation in the experimental conditions of load and speed,
with a view to detect the existence of constant errors; but owing to
the limitations imposed by the use of a steam-engine, and the
difficulty of securing steady conditions of running, this proved to be
impossible. There can be no doubt, however, that the final result is
the most accurate direct determination of the value of the mean
calorie between 0¬∞ and 100¬∞ C. in mechanical units. Expressed in
joules per calorie the result is 4.1832, which agrees very closely with
the value found by Rowland as the mean over the range 15¬∞ to 20¬∞ C.
The value 4.183 is independently confirmed in a remarkable manner
by the results of the electrical method described below, which give
4.185 joules for the mean calorie, if Rowland&rsquo;s value is assumed as
the starting-point, and taken to be 4.180 joules at 20¬∞ C.</p>

<p>¬ß 11. <i>Electrical Methods.</i>&mdash;The value of the international
electrical units has by this time been so accurately determined in
absolute measure that they afford a very good, though indirect,
method of determining the mechanical equivalent of heat. But,
quite apart from this, electrical methods possess the greatest
value for calorimetry, on account of the facility and accuracy of
regulating and measuring the quantity of heat supplied by an
electric current. The frictional generation of heat in a metallic
wire conveying a current can be measured in various ways, which
correspond to slightly different methods. By Ohm&rsquo;s law, and by
the definition of difference of electric pressure or potential, we
obtain the following alternative expressions for the quantity of
heat H in joules generated in a time T seconds by a current of
C amperes flowing in a wire of resistance R ohms, the difference
of potential between the ends of the wire being E = CR volts:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">The method corresponding to the expression C<span class="sp">2</span>RT was adopted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
by Joule and by most of the early experimentalists. The defects
of the earlier work from an electrical point of view lay chiefly in
the difficulty of measuring the current with sufficient accuracy
owing to the imperfect development of the science of electrical
measurement. These difficulties have been removed by the great
advances since 1880, and in particular by the introduction of
accurate standard cells for measurements of electrical pressure.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>¬ß 12. <i>Griffiths</i>.&mdash;The method adopted by E.H. Griffiths (<i>Phil.
Trans.,</i> 1893, p. 361), whose work threw a great deal of light on the
failure of previous observers to secure consistent results, corresponded
to the last expression E<span class="sp">2</span>T/R, and consisted in regulating
the current by a special rheostat, so as to keep the potential difference
E on the terminals of the resistance <i>R</i> balanced against a given
number of standard Clark cells of the Board of Trade pattern. The
resistance <i>R</i> could be deduced from a knowledge of the temperature
of the calorimeter and the coefficient of the wire. But in order to
obtain trustworthy results by this method he found it necessary
to employ very rapid stirring (2000 revolutions per minute), and to
insulate the wire very carefully from the liquid to prevent leakage
of the current. He also made a special experiment to find how much
the temperature of the wire exceeded that of the liquid under the
conditions of the experiment. This correction had been neglected
by previous observers employing similar methods. The resistance
<i>R</i> was about 9 ohms, and the potential difference E was varied from
three to six Clark cells, giving a rate of heat-supply about 2 to 6
watts. The water equivalent of the calorimeter was about 85
grammes, and was determined by varying the quantity of water from
140 to 260 or 280 grammes, so that the final results depended on a
difference in the weight of water of 120 to 140 grammes. The range
of temperature in each experiment was 14¬∞ to 26¬∞ C. The rate of rise
was observed with a mercury thermometer standardized by comparison
with a platinum thermometer under the conditions of the
experiment. The time of passing each division was recorded on an
electric chronograph. The duration of an experiment varied from
about 30 to 70 minutes. Special observations were made to determine
the corrections for the heat supplied by stirring, and that lost
by radiation, each of which amounted to about 10% of the heat-supply.
The calorimeter C, fig. 8, was gilded, and completely
surrounded by a nickel-plated steel enclosure B, forming the bulb
of a mercury thermo-regulator, immersed in a large water-bath
maintained at a constant temperature. In spite of the large corrections
the results were extremely consistent, and the value of the
temperature-coefficient of the diminution of the specific heat of
water, deduced from the observed variation in the rate of rise at
different points of the range 15¬∞ to 25¬∞, agreed with the value subsequently
deduced from Rowland&rsquo;s experiments over the same range,
when his thermometers were reduced to the same scale. Griffiths&rsquo;
final result for the average value of the calorie over this range was
4.192 joules, taking the E.M.F. of the Clark cell at 15¬∞ C. to be
1.4342 volts. The difference from Rowland&rsquo;s value, 4.181, could
be explained by supposing the E.M.F. of the Clark cells to have in
reality been 1.4323 volts, or about 2 millivolts less than the value
assumed. Griffiths subsequently applied the same method to the
measurement of the specific heat of aniline, and the latent heat of
vaporization of benzene and water.</p>

<p>¬ß 13. <i>Schuster and Gannon.</i>&mdash;The method employed by A. Schuster
and W. Gannon for the determination of the specific heat of water in
terms of the international electric units (<i>Phil. Trans.</i> A, 1895, p. 415)
corresponded to the expression ECT, and differed in many essential
details from that of Griffiths. The current through a platinoid
resistance of about 31 ohms in a calorimeter containing 1500 grammes
of water was regulated so that the potential difference on its terminals
was equal to that of twenty Board of Trade Clark cells in
series. The duration of an experiment was about ten minutes, and
the product of the mean current and the time, namely CT, was
measured by the weight of silver deposited in a voltameter, which
amounted to about 0.56 gramme. The uncertainty due to the correction
for the water equivalent was minimized by making it small
(about 27 grammes) in comparison with the water weight. The
correction for external loss was reduced by employing a small rise
of temperature (only 2.22¬∞), and making the rate of heat-supply
relatively rapid, nearly 24 watts. The platinoid coil was insulated
from the water by shellac varnish. The wire had a length of 760 cms.,
and the potential difference on its terminals was nearly 30 volts. The
rate of stirring adopted was so slow that the heat generated by it
could be neglected. The result found was 4.191 joules per calorie
at 19¬∞ C. This agrees very well with Griffiths considering the
difficulty of measuring so small a rise of temperature at 2¬∞ with a
mercury thermometer. Admitting that the electro-chemical equivalent
of silver increases with the age of the solution, a fact subsequently
discovered, and that the E.M.F. of the Clark cell is probably
less than 1.4340 volts (the value assumed by Schuster and Gannon),
there is no difficulty in reconciling the result with that of Rowland.</p>

<p>¬ß 14. <i>H.L. Callendar and H.T. Barnes</i> (<i>Brit. Assoc. Reports,</i> 1897
and 1899) adopted an entirely different method of calorimetry, as well
as a different method of electrical measurement. A steady current
of liquid, Q grammes per second, of specific heat, Js joules per degree,
flowing through a fine tube, A B, fig. 9, is heated by a steady electric
current during its passage through the tube, and the difference of
temperature d&theta; between the inflowing and the outflowing liquid is
measured by a single reading with a delicate pair of differential
platinum thermometers at A and B. The difference of potential
E between the ends of the tube, and the electric current C through
it, are measured on an accurately calibrated potentiometer, in terms
of a Clark cell and a standard resistance. If hd&theta; is the radiation
loss in watts we have the equation,</p>

<p class="center ptb1">EC = JsQd&theta; + hd&theta;&emsp;&emsp;(2).</p>

<p class="noind">The advantage of this method is that all the conditions are steady,
so that the observations can be pushed to the limit of accuracy and
sensitiveness of the apparatus. The water equivalent of the calorimeter
is immaterial, since there is no appreciable change of temperature.
The heat-loss can be reduced to a minimum by enclosing
the flow-tube in a hermetically sealed glass vacuum jacket. Stirring
is effected by causing the water to circulate spirally round the bulbs
of the thermometers and the heating conductor as indicated in the
figure. The conditions can be very easily varied through a wide
range. The heat-loss <i>hd&theta;</i> is determined and eliminated by varying
the flow of liquid and the electric current simultaneously, in such
a manner as to secure approximately the same rise of temperature
for two or more widely different values of the flow of liquid. An
example taken from the <i>Electrician</i>, September 1897, of one of the
earliest experiments by this method on the specific heat of mercury
will make the method clearer. The flow-tube was about 1 metre
long and 1 millim. in diameter, coiled in a short spiral inside the
vacuum jacket. The outside of the vacuum jacket was immersed
in a water jacket at a steady temperature equal to that of the inflowing
mercury.</p>

<p class="noind">It is assumed as a first approximation that the heat-loss is proportional
to the rise of temperature d&theta;, provided that d&theta; is nearly the
same in both cases, and that the distribution of temperature in the
apparatus is the same for the same rise of temperature whatever the
flow of liquid. The result calculated on these assumptions is given
in the last column in joules, and also in calories of 20¬∞ C. The heat-loss
in this example is large, nearly 4.5% of the total supply, owing
to the small flow and the large rise of temperature, but this correction
was greatly reduced in subsequent observations on the specific heat
of water by the same method. In the case of mercury the liquid
itself can be utilized to conduct the electric current. In the case of
water or other liquids it is necessary to employ a platinum wire
stretched along the tube as heating conductor. This introduces
additional difficulties of construction, but does not otherwise affect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
the method. The absolute value of the specific heat deduced necessarily
depends on the absolute values of the electrical standards
employed in the investigation. But for the determination of relative
values of specific heats in terms of a standard liquid, or of the variations
of specific heat of a liquid, the method depends only on the
constancy of the standards, which can be readily and accurately
tested. The absolute value of the E.M.F. of the Clark cells employed
was determined with a special form of electrodynamometer
(Callendar, <i>Phil. Trans.</i> A. 313, p. 81), and found to be 1.4334 volts,
assuming the ohm to be correct. Assuming this value, the result
found by this method for the specific heat of water at 20¬∞ C. agrees
with that of Rowland within the probable limits of error.</p>

<p>¬ß 15. <i>Variation of Specific Heat of Water.</i>&mdash;The question of the
variation of the specific heat of water has a peculiar interest and
importance in connexion with the choice of a thermal unit. Many
of the uncertainties in the reduction of older experiments, such as
those of Regnault, arise from uncertainty in regard to the unit in
terms of which they are expressed, which again depends on the scale
of the particular thermometer employed in the investigation. The
first experiments of any value were those of Regnault in 1847 on the
specific heat of water between 110¬∞ C. and 192¬∞ C. They were conducted
on a very large scale by the method of mixture, but showed
discrepancies of the order of 0.5%, and the calculated results in many
cases do not agree with the data. This may be due merely to deficient
explanation of details of tabulation. We may probably take
the tabulated values as showing correctly the rate of variation
between 110¬∞ and 190¬∞ C., but the values in terms of any particular
thermal unit must remain uncertain to at least 0.5% owing to the
uncertainties of the thermometry. Regnault himself adopted the
formula,</p>

<p class="center ptb1">s = 1 + 0.00004t + 0.0000009t<span class="sp">2</span> (Regnault), &emsp;&emsp;(3)</p>

<p class="noind">for the specific heat s at any temperature t C. in terms of the specific
heat at 0¬∞ C. taken as the standard. This formula has since been
very generally applied over the whole range 0¬∞ to 200¬∞ C., but the
experiments could not in reality give any information with regard
to the specific heat at temperatures below 100¬∞ C. The linear formula
proposed by J. Bosscha from an independent reduction of Regnault&rsquo;s
experiments is probably within the limits of accuracy between 100¬∞
and 200¬∞ C., so far as the mean rate of variation is concerned, but
the absolute values require reduction. It may be written&mdash;</p>

<p class="center ptb1">s = S<span class="su">100</span> + .00023(t &minus; 100) &emsp;(Bosscha-Regnault) &emsp;&emsp;(4).</p>

<p>The work of L. Pfaundler and H. Platter, of G.A. Hirn, of J.C.
Jamin and Amaury, and of many other experimentalists who succeeded
Regnault, appeared to indicate much larger rates of increase
than he had found, but there can be little doubt that the
discrepancies of their results, which often exceeded 5%, were due
to lack of appreciation of the difficulties of calorimetric measurements.
The work of Rowland by the mechanical method was the
first in which due attention was paid to the thermometry and to
the reduction of the results to the absolute scale of temperature.
The agreement of his corrected results with those of Griffiths by
a very different method, left very little doubt with regard to the
rate of diminution of the specific heat of water at 20¬∞ C. The work
of A. Bartoli and E. Stracciati by the method of mixture between
0¬∞ and 30¬∞ C., though their curve is otherwise similar to Rowland&rsquo;s,
had appeared to indicate a minimum at 20¬∞ C., followed by a rapid
rise. This lowering of the minimum was probably due to some
constant errors inherent in their method of experiment. The more
recent work of L√ºdin, 1895, under the direction of Prof. J. Pernet,
extended from 0¬∞ to 100¬∞ C., and appears to have attained as high
a degree of excellence as it is possible to reach by the employment of
mercury thermometers in conjunction with the method of mixture.
His results, exhibited in fig. 6, show a minimum at 25¬∞ C., and a
maximum at 87¬∞ C., the values being .9935 and 1.0075 respectively
in terms of the mean specific heat between 0¬∞ and 100¬∞ C. He paid
great attention to the thermometry, and the discrepancies of individual
measurements at any one point nowhere exceed 0.3%, but
he did not vary the conditions of the experiments materially, and it
does not appear that the well-known constant errors of the method
could have been completely eliminated by the devices which he
adopted. The rapid rise from 25¬∞ to 75¬∞ may be due to radiation
error from the hot water supply, and the subsequent fall of the
curve to the inevitable loss of heat by evaporation of the boiling
water on its way to the calorimeter. It must be observed, however,
that there is another grave difficulty in the accurate determination
of the specific heat of water near 100¬∞ C. by this method, namely, that
the quantity actually observed is not the specific heat <i>at</i> the higher
temperature t, but the <i>mean specific heat</i> over the range 18¬∞ to t.
The specific heat itself can be deduced only by differentiating the
curve of observation, which greatly increases the uncertainty. The
peculiar advantage of the electric method of Callendar and Barnes,
already referred to, is that the specific heat itself is determined over
a range of 8¬∞ to 10¬∞ at each point, by adding accurately measured
quantities of heat to the water at the desired temperature in an
isothermal enclosure, under perfectly steady conditions, without
any possibility of evaporation or loss of heat in transference. These
experiments, which have been extended by Barnes over the whole
range 0¬∞ to 100¬∞, agree very well with Rowland and Griffiths in the
rate of variation at 20¬∞ C., but show a rather flat minimum of specific
heat in the neighbourhood of 38¬∞ to 40¬∞ C. At higher points the rate
of variation is very similar to that of Regnault&rsquo;s curve, but taking the
specific heat at 20¬∞ as the standard of reference, the actual values
are nearly 0.56% less than Regnault&rsquo;s. It appears probable that
his values for higher temperatures may be adopted with this reduction,
which is further confirmed by the results of Reynolds and
Moorby, and by those of L√ºdin. According to the electric method,
the whole range of variation of the specific heat between 10¬∞ and
80¬∞ is only 0.5%. Comparatively simple formulae, therefore, suffice
for its expression to 1 in 10,000, which is beyond the limits of accuracy
of the observations. It is more convenient in practice to use a few
simple formulae, than to attempt to represent the whole range by a
single complicated expression:&mdash;</p>

<p>The addition of the cubic term below 20¬∞ is intended to represent
the somewhat more rapid change near the freezing-point. This
effect is probably due, as suggested by Rowland, to the presence of
a certain proportion of ice molecules in the liquid, which is also
no doubt the cause of the anomalous expansion. Above 60¬∞ C.
Regnault&rsquo;s formula is adopted, the absolute values being simply
diminished by a constant quantity 0.0056 to allow for the probable
errors of his thermometry. Above 100¬∞ C., and for approximate
work generally, the simpler formula of Bosscha, similarly corrected,
is probably adequate.</p>

<p>The following table of values, calculated from these formulae,
is taken from the <i>Brit. Assoc. Report,</i> 1899, with a slight modification
to allow for the increase in the specific heat below 20¬∞ C. This was
estimated in 1899 as being equivalent to the addition of the constant
quantity 0.20 to the values of the total heat h of the liquid as
reckoned by the parabolic formula (5). This quantity is now, as the
result of further experiments, added to the values of h, and also represented
in the formula for the specific heat itself by the cubic term.</p>

specific heat of water at 20¬∞ C. for the reasons given below. This
unit is taken as being 4.180 joules per gramme-degree-centigrade
on the scale of the platinum thermometer, corrected to the absolute
scale as explained in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Thermometry</a></span>, which has been shown
to be practically equivalent to the hydrogen scale. The value 4.180
joules at 20¬∞ C. is the mean between Rowland&rsquo;s corrected result
4.181 and the value 4.179, deduced from the experiments of Reynolds
and Moorby on the assumption that the ratio of the mean specific
heat 0¬∞ to 100¬∞ to that at 20¬∞ is 1.0016, as given by the formulae representing
the results of Callendar and Barnes. This would indicate
that Rowland&rsquo;s corrected values should, if anything, be lowered. In
any case the value of the mechanical equivalent is uncertain to at
least 1 in 2000.</p>

<p>The mean specific heat, over any range of temperature, may be
obtained by integrating the formulae between the limits required,
or by taking the difference of the corresponding values of the total
heat <i>h</i>, and dividing by the range of temperature. The quantity
actually observed by Rowland was the total heat. It may be remarked
that starting from the same value at 5¬∞, for the sake of
comparison, Rowland&rsquo;s values of the total heat agree to 1 in 5000
with those calculated from the formulae. The values of the total
heat observed by Regnault, as reduced by Shaw, also show a very
fair agreement, considering the uncertainty of the units. It must
be admitted that it is desirable to redetermine the variation of the
specific heat above 100¬∞ C. This is very difficult on account of the
steam-pressure, and could not easily be accomplished by the electrical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span>
method. Callendar has, however, devised a continuous method of
mixture, which appears to be peculiarly adapted to the purpose,
and promises to give more certain results. In any case it may be
remarked that formulae such as those of Jamin, Henrichsen, Baumgartner,
Winkelmann or Dieterici, which give far more rapid rates
of increase than that of Regnault, cannot possibly be reconciled
with his observations, or with those of Reynolds and Moorby, or
Callendar and Barnes, and are certainly inapplicable above 100¬∞ C.</p>
</div>

<p>¬ß 16. <i>On the Choice of the Thermal Unit.</i>&mdash;So much uncertainty
still prevails on this fundamental point that it cannot be passed
over without reference. There are three possible kinds of unit,
depending on the three fundamental methods already given:
(1) the thermometric unit, or the thermal capacity of unit mass
of a standard substance under given conditions of temperature
and pressure on the scale of a standard thermometer. (2) The
latent-heat unit, or the quantity of heat required to melt or
vaporize unit mass of a standard substance under given conditions.
This unit has the advantage of being independent of thermometry,
but the applicability of these methods is limited to special cases,
and the relation of the units to other units is difficult to determine.
(3) The absolute or mechanical unit, the quantity of heat
equivalent to a given quantity of mechanical or electrical energy.
This can be very accurately realized, but is not so convenient as
(1) for ordinary purposes.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In any case it is necessary to define a thermometric unit of class
(1). The standard substance must be a liquid. Water is always
selected, although some less volatile liquid, such as aniline or mercury,
would possess many advantages. With regard to the scale of temperature,
there is very general agreement that the absolute scale
as realized by the hydrogen or helium thermometer should be
adopted as the ultimate standard of reference. But as the hydrogen
thermometer is not directly available for the majority of experiments,
it is necessary to use a secondary standard for the practical definition
of the unit. The electrical resistance thermometer of platinum
presents very great advantages for this purpose over the mercury
thermometer in point of reproducibility, accuracy and adaptability
to the practical conditions of experiment. The conditions of use
of a mercury thermometer in a calorimetric experiment are necessarily
different from those under which its corrections are determined,
and this difference must inevitably give rise to constant errors in
practical work. The primary consideration in the definition of a
unit is to select that method which permits the highest order of
accuracy in comparison and verification. For this reason the definition
of the thermal unit will in the end probably be referred to
a scale of temperature defined in terms of a standard platinum
thermometer.</p>

<p>There is more diversity of opinion with regard to the question
of the standard temperature. Many authors, adopting Regnault&rsquo;s
formula, have selected 0¬∞ C. as the standard temperature, but this
cannot be practically realized in the case of water, and his formula
is certainly erroneous at low temperatures. A favourite temperature
to select is 4¬∞ C., the temperature of maximum density, since
at this point the specific heat at constant volume is the same as that
at constant pressure But this is really of no consequence, since
the specific heat at constant volume cannot be practically realized.
The specific heat at 4¬∞ could be accurately determined at the mean
over the range 0¬∞ to 8¬∞ keeping the jacket at 0¬∞ C. But the change
appears to be rather rapid near 0¬∞, the temperature is inconveniently
low for ordinary calorimetric work, and the unit at 4¬∞ would be so
much larger than the specific heat at ordinary temperatures that
nearly all experiments would require reduction. The natural point
to select would be that of minimum specific heat, but if this occurs
at 40¬∞ C. it would be inconveniently high for practical realization
except by the continuous electrical method. It was proposed by a
committee of the British Association to select the temperature at
which the specific heat was 4.200 joules, leaving the exact temperature
to be subsequently determined. It was supposed at the time,
from the original reduction of Rowland&rsquo;s experiments, that this
would be nearly at 10¬∞ C., but it now appears that it may be as low
is 5¬∞ C., which would be inconvenient. This is really only an
absolute unit in disguise, and evades the essential point, which is
the selection of a standard temperature for the water thermometric
unit. A similar objection applies to selecting the temperature at
which the specific heat is equal to its mean value between 0¬∞ and
100¬∞. The mean calorie cannot be accurately realized in practice
in any simple manner, and is therefore unsuitable as a standard of
comparison. Its relation to the calorie at any given temperature,
such as 15¬∞ or 20¬∞, cannot be determined with the same degree of
accuracy as the ratio of the specific heat at 15¬∞ to that at 20¬∞, if the
scale of temperature is given. The most practical unit is the
calorie at 15¬∞ or 20¬∞ or some temperature in the range of ordinary
practice. The temperature most generally favoured is 15¬∞, but 20¬∞
would be more suitable for accurate work. These units differ only
by 11 parts in 10,000 according to Callendar and Barnes, or by 13
in 10,000 according to Rowland and Griffiths, so that the difference
between them is of no great importance for ordinary purposes.
But for purposes of definition it would be necessary to take the
mean value of the specific heat <i>over a given range</i> of temperature,
preferably at least 10¬∞, rather than the specific heat <i>at a point</i> which
necessitates reference to some formula of reduction for the rate of
variation. The specific heat at 15¬∞ would be determined with
reference to the mean over the range 10¬∞ to 20¬∞, and that at 20¬∞
from the range 15¬∞ to 25¬∞. There can be no doubt that the range
10¬∞ to 20¬∞ is too low for the accurate thermal regulation of the
conditions of the experiment. The range 15¬∞ to 25¬∞ would be much
more convenient from this point of view, and a mean temperature
of 20¬∞ is probably nearest the average of accurate calorimetric work.
For instance 20¬∞ is the mean of the range of the experiments of
Griffiths and of Rowland, and is close to that of Schuster and
Gannon. It is readily attainable at any time in a modern laboratory
with adequate heating arrangements, and is probably on the whole
the most suitable temperature to select.</p>

<p>¬ß 17. <i>Specific Heat of Gases.</i>&mdash;In the case of solids and liquids
under ordinary conditions of pressure, the external work of
expansion is so small that it may generally be neglected; but
with gases or vapours, or with liquids near the critical point, the
external work becomes so large that it is essential to specify the
conditions under which the specific heat is measured. The most
important cases are, the specific heats (1) at constant volume;
(2) at constant pressure; (3) at saturation pressure in the case of
a liquid or vapour. In consequence of the small thermal capacity
of gases and vapours per unit volume at ordinary pressures, the
difficulties of direct measurement are almost insuperable except
in case (2). Thus the direct experimental evidence is somewhat
meagre and conflicting, but the question of the relation of the
specific heats of gases is one of great interest in connexion with
the kinetic theory and the constitution of the molecule. The
well-known experiments of Regnault and Wiedemann on the
specific heat of gases at constant pressure agree in showing that
the <i>molecular specific heat,</i> or the thermal capacity of the molecular
weight in grammes, is approximately independent of the
temperature and pressure in case of the more stable diatomic
gases, such as H<span class="su">2</span>, O<span class="su">2</span>, N<span class="su">2</span>, CO, &amp;c., and has nearly the same value
for each gas. They also indicate that it is much larger, and
increases considerably with rise of temperature, in the case of
more condensible vapours, such as Cl<span class="su">2</span>, Br<span class="su">2</span>, or more complicated
molecules, such as CO<span class="su">2</span>, N<span class="su">2</span>O, NH<span class="su">3</span>, C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">4</span>. The direct determination
of the specific heat at constant volume is extremely difficult,
but has been successfully attempted by Joly with his steam
calorimeter, in the case of air and CO<span class="su">2</span>. Employing pressures
between 7 and 27 atmospheres, he found that the specific heat of
air between 10¬∞ and 100¬∞ C. increased very slightly with increase
of density, but that of CO<span class="su">2</span> increased nearly 3% between 7 and 21
atmospheres. The following formulae represent his results for
the specific heat <i>s</i> at constant volume in terms of the density <i>d</i> in
gms. per c. c.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>¬ß 18. <i>Ratio of Specific Heats.</i>&mdash;According to the elementary kinetic
theory of an ideal gas, the molecules of which are so small and so
far apart that their mutual actions may be neglected, the kinetic
energy of translation of the molecules is proportional to the absolute
temperature, and is equal to <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> of pv, the product of the pressure
and the volume, per unit mass. The expansion per degree at
constant pressure is v/&theta; = R/p. The external work of expansion
per degree is equal to R, being the product of the pressure and the
expansion, and represents the difference of the specific heats S - s,
at constant pressure and volume, assuming as above that the internal
work of expansion is negligible. If the molecules are supposed
to be like smooth, hard, elastic spheres, incapable of receiving any
other kind of energy except that of translation, the specific heat at
constant volume would be the increase per degree of the kinetic
energy namely 3pv/2&theta; &minus; 3R/2, that at constant pressure would be
5R/2, and the ratio of the specific heats would be <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> or 1.666. This
appears to be actually the case for monatomic gases such as mercury
vapour (Kundt and Warburg, 1876), argon and helium (Ramsay,
1896). For diatomic or compound gases Clerk Maxwell supposed
that the molecule would also possess energy of rotation, and endeavoured
to prove that in this case the energy would be equally
divided between the six degrees of freedom, three of translation
and three of rotation, if the molecule were regarded as a rigid body
incapable of vibration-energy. In this case we should have s = 3R,
S = 4R, S/s = <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> = 1.333. In 1879 Maxwell considered it one of the
greatest difficulties which the kinetic theory had yet encountered,
that in spite of the many other degrees of freedom of vibration
revealed by the spectroscope, the experimental value of the ratio
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
<i>S/s</i> was 1.40 for so many gases, instead of being less than <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>. Somewhat
later L. Boltzmann suggested that a diatomic molecule regarded
as a rigid dumb-bell or figure of rotation, might have only five
effective degrees of freedom, since the energy of rotation about the
axis of symmetry could not be altered by collisions between the
molecules. The theoretical value of the ratio S/s in this case would
be the required <span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>. For a rigid molecule on this theory the smallest
value possible would be <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>. Since much smaller values are found
for more complex molecules, we may suppose that, in these cases,
the energy of rotation of a polyatomic molecule may be greater
than its energy of translation, or else that heat is expended in
splitting up molecular aggregates, and increasing energy of vibration.
A hypothesis doubtfully attributed to Maxwell is that each additional
atom in the molecule is equivalent to two extra degrees of
freedom. From an m-atomic molecule we should then have
S/s = 1 + 2/(2m + 1). This gives a series of ratios <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, <span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>, <span class="spp">9</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span>, <span class="spp">11</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">9</span>,
&amp;c., for 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c., atoms in the molecule, values which fall
within the limits of experimental error in many cases. It is not at
all clear, however, that energy of vibration should bear a constant
ratio to that of translation, although this would probably be the
case for rotation. For the simpler gases, which are highly diathermanous
and radiate badly even at high temperature, the energy
of vibration is probably very small, except under the special conditions
which produce luminosity in flames and electric discharges.
For such gases, assuming a constant ratio of rotation to translation,
the specific heat at low pressures would be very nearly constant.
For more complex molecules the radiative and absorptive powers
are known to be much greater. The energy of vibration may be
appreciable at ordinary temperatures, and would probably increase
more rapidly than that of translation with rise of temperature,
especially near a point of dissociation. This would account for
an increase of S, and a diminution of the ratio S/s, with rise of
temperature which apparently occurs in many vapours. The experimental
evidence, however, is somewhat conflicting, and further
investigations are very desirable on the variation of specific heat
with temperature. Given the specific heat as a function of the
temperature, its variation with pressure may be determined from
the characteristic equation of the gas. The direct methods of
measuring the ratio S/s, by the velocity of sound and by adiabatic
expansion, are sufficiently described in many text-books.</p>

<p>¬ß 19. <i>Atomic and Molecular Heats.</i>&mdash;The ideal atomic heat is the
thermal capacity of a gramme-atom in the ideal state of monatomic
gas at constant volume. This would be nearly three calories. For
a diatomic gas, the molecular heat would be nearly five calories,
or the atomic heat of a gas in the diatomic state would be 2.5. Estimated
at constant pressure the atomic heat would be 3.5. Some
authors adopt 2.5 and some 3.5 for the ideal atomic heat. The
atomic heat of a metal in the solid state is in most cases larger than
six calories at ordinary temperatures. Considering the wide variations
in the physical condition and melting points, the comparatively
close agreement of the atomic heats of the metals at ordinary temperatures,
known as Dulong and Petit&rsquo;s Law, is very remarkable.
The specific heats as a rule increase with rise of temperature, in some
cases, <i>e.g.</i> iron and nickel, very rapidly. According to W.A. Tilden
(<i>Phil. Trans.,</i> 1900), the atomic heats of pure nickel and cobalt, as
determined from experiments at the boiling-points of O<span class="su">2</span>, and CO<span class="su">2</span>,
diminish so rapidly at temperatures below 0¬∞ C. as to suggest that
they would reach the value 2.42 at the absolute zero. This is the
value of the minimum of atomic heat calculated by Perry from
diatomic hydrogen, but the observations themselves might be
equally well represented by taking the imaginary limit 3, since the
quantity actually observed is the mean specific heat between 0¬∞ and
&minus;182.5¬∞ C. Subsequent experiments on other metals at low temperatures
did not indicate a similar diminution of specific heat, so
that it may be doubted whether the atomic heats really approach
the ideal value at the absolute zero. No doubt there must be
approximate relations between the atomic and molecular heats of
similar elements and compounds, but considering the great variations
of specific heat with temperature and physical state, in alloys,
mixtures or solutions, and in allotropic or other modifications, it
would be idle to expect that the specific heat of a compound could
be accurately deduced by any simple additive process from that of
its constituents.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALOVIUS, ABRAHAM<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> (1612-1686), German Lutheran
divine, was born at Mohrungen in east Prussia, on the 16th of
April 1612. After studying at K√∂nigsberg, in 1650 he was
appointed professor of theology at Wittenberg, where he afterwards
became general superintendent and primarius. He died
on the 25th of February 1686. Calovius was the most noteworthy
of the champions of Lutheran orthodoxy in the 17th century.
He strongly opposed the Catholics, Calvinists and Socinians,
attacked in particular the reconciliation policy or &ldquo;syncretism&rdquo;
of Georg Calixtus (cf. the <i>Consensus repetitus fidei vere lutheranae,</i>
1665), and as a writer of polemics he had few equals. His chief
dogmatic work, <i>Systema locorum theologicorum</i> (12 vols. 1655-1677),
represents the climax of Lutheran scholasticism. In his
<i>Biblia Illustrata</i> (4 vols.), written from the point of view of a
very strict belief in inspiration, his object is to refute the statements
made by Hugo Grotius in his Commentaries. His <i>Historia
Syncretistica</i> (1682) was suppressed.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CALPURNIUS, TITUS,<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> Roman bucolic poet, surnamed <span class="sc">Siculus</span>
from his birthplace or from his imitation of the style of the
Sicilian Theocritus, most probably flourished during the reign of
Nero. Eleven eclogues have been handed down to us under his
name, of which the last four, from metrical considerations and
express MS. testimony, are now generally attributed to Nemesianus
(<i>q.v.</i>), who lived in the time of the emperor Carus and his
sons (latter half of the 3rd century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>). Hardly anything is
known of the life of Calpurnius; we gather from the poems
themselves (in which he is obviously represented by &ldquo;Corydon&rdquo;)
that he was in poor circumstances and was on the point of
emigrating to Spain, when &ldquo;Meliboeus&rdquo; came to his aid.
Through his influence Calpurnius apparently secured a post at
Rome. The time at which Calpurnius lived has been much
discussed, but all the indications seem to point to the time of Nero.
The emperor is described as a handsome youth, like Mars and
Apollo, whose accession marks the beginning of a new golden age,
prognosticated by the appearance of a comet, doubtless the same
that appeared some time before the death of Claudius; he
exhibits splendid games in the amphitheatre (probably the
wooden amphitheatre erected by Nero in 57); and in the words</p>

<p class="center ptb1">maternis causam qui vicit Iulis<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (i. 45),</p>

<p class="noind">there is a reference to the speech delivered in Greek by Nero on
behalf of the Ilienses (Suetonius, <i>Nero</i>, 7; Tacitus, <i>Annals</i>, xii.
58), from whom the Julii derived their family.<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Meliboeus, the
poet&rsquo;s patron, has been variously identified with Columella,
Seneca the philosopher, and C. Calpurnius Piso. Although the
sphere of Meliboeus&rsquo;s literary activity (as indicated in iv. 53)
suits none of these, what is known of Calpurnius Piso fits in well
with what is said of Meliboeus by the poet, who speaks of his
generosity, his intimacy with the emperor, and his interest in
tragic poetry. His claim is further supported by the poem <i>De
Laude Pisonis</i> (ed. C.F. Weber, 1859) which has come down to us
without the name of the author, but which there is considerable
reason for attributing to Calpurnius.<a name="fa3c" id="fa3c" href="#ft3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The poem exhibits a
striking similarity with the eclogues in metre, language and
subject-matter. The author of the <i>Laus</i> is young, of respectable
family and desirous of gaining the favour of Piso as his Maecenas.
Further, the similarity between the two names can hardly be
accidental; it is suggested that the poet may have been adopted
by the courtier, or that he was the son of a freedman of Piso.
The attitude of the author of the <i>Laus</i> towards the subject of the
panegyric seems to show less intimacy than the relations between
Corydon and Meliboeus in the eclogues, and there is internal
evidence that the <i>Laus</i> was written during the reign of Claudius
(Teuffel-Schwabe, <i>Hist, of Rom. Lit.</i> ¬ß 306, 6).</p>

<p>Mention may here be made of the fragments of two short
hexameter poems in an Einsiedeln MS., obviously belonging to
the time of Nero, which if not written by Calpurnius, were
imitated from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span></p>

<p>Although there is nothing original in Calpurnius, he is &ldquo;a
skilful literary craftsman.&rdquo; Of his models the chief is Virgil, of
whom (under the name of Tityrus) he speaks with great enthusiasm;
he is also indebted to Ovid and Theocritus. Calpurnius
is &ldquo;a fair scholar, and an apt courtier, and not devoid of
real poetical feeling. The bastard style of pastoral cultivated by
him, in which the description of nature is made the writer&rsquo;s
pretext, while ingenious flattery is his real purpose, nevertheless
excludes genuine pleasure, and consequently genuine poetical
achievement. He may be fairly compared to the minor poets of
the reign of Anne&rdquo; (Garnett).</p>

Pop. (1901) 43,303. The town is of Saracenic origin, as its name
<i>Kalat-al-Nisa</i>, the &ldquo;Ladies&rsquo; Castle,&rdquo; indicates, and some ruins
of the old castle (called <i>Pietrarossa</i>) still exist. Otherwise the
town contains no buildings of artistic or historical interest, but it
commands striking views. It is the centre of the Sicilian sulphur
industry and the seat of a royal school of mines. Two miles east
is the interesting Norman abbey of S. Spirito.</p>

from the Lat. <i>calx</i>, a heel, and <i>trappa</i>, Late Lat. for a snare), an
iron ball, used as an obstacle against cavalry, with four spikes so
arranged, that however placed in or on the ground, one spike

<p><span class="bold">CALUMET<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> (Norm. Fr. form of <i>chalumet</i>, from Lat. <i>calamus</i>, a
reed), the name given by the French in Canada to the &ldquo;peace-pipe&rdquo;
of the American Indians. This pipe occupied among the
tribes a position of peculiar symbolic significance, and was the
object of profound veneration. It was smoked on all ceremonial
occasions, even on declarations of war, but its special use was at
the making of treaties of peace. It was usually about 2¬Ω ft. long,
and in the west the bowl was made of red pipes tone (catlinite), a
fine-grained, easily-worked stone of a rich red colour found
chiefly in the C√¥teau des Prairies west of Big Stone Lake, Dakota.
The quarries were formerly neutral ground among the warring
Indian tribes, many sacred traditions being associated with the
locality and its product (Longfellow, <i>Hiawatha</i>, i.). The pipe
stem was of reed decorated with eagles&rsquo; quills or women&rsquo;s hair.
Native tobacco mixed with willow-bark or sumac leaves was
smoked. The pipe was offered as a supreme proof of hospitality
to distinguished strangers, and its refusal was regarded as a
grievous affront. In the east and south-east, the bowl was of
white stone, sometimes pierced with several stem holes so that
many persons might smoke at once.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALVADOS,<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span> a department of north-western France, formed
in 1790 out of Bessin, Cinglais, Hi√©mois, Bocage, the Campagne
de Caen, Auge and the western part of Lieuvin. Pop. (1906)
403,431. Area, 2197 sq. m. It received its name from a ledge
of rocks, stretching along the coast for a distance of about 15 m.
between the mouths of the rivers Orne and Vire. It is bounded N.
by the English Channel, E. by the department of Eure, S. by that
of Orne, W. by that of Manche. The Bocage, or south-western
part of the department, is elevated, being crossed from south-east
to north-west by the hills of Normandy, the highest of which is
1197 ft.; the rest of the surface is gently undulating, and consists
of extensive valleys watered by numerous streams which fall into
the English Channel. The coast, formed by cliffs, sandy beaches
or reefs, is generally inaccessible, except at the mouths of the
principal rivers, such as the Touques, the Dives, the Orne and
the Vire, which are navigable at high tide for several miles inland.
Trouville is the chief of the numerous coast resorts. The climate,
though humid and variable, is healthy. The raising of cattle,
sheep and horses is the mainstay of the agriculture of the department.
Pasture is good and abundant in the east and north-west,
and there is a large export trade in the butter, eggs and
cheese (Camembert, Livarot, Pont l&rsquo;Ev√™que) of these districts,
carried on by Honfleur, Isigny and other ports. The plain of
Caen is a great centre for horse breeding. Wheat, oats, barley,
colza and potatoes are the chief crops. The orchards of Auge
and Bessin produce a superior kind of cider, of which upwards of
40,000,000 gallons are made in the department; a large quantity
of cider brandy (eau-de-vie de Calvados) is distilled. Poultry
to a considerable amount is sent to the Paris markets, and there
is a large output of honey and wax. The spinning and weaving
of wool and cotton are the chief industries. Besides these,
paper-mills, oil-mills, tanneries, saw-mills, shipbuilding yards,
rope-works, dye-works, distilleries and bleach-fields, scattered
throughout the department, give employment to a number of
hands. There are productive iron-mines and building-stone,
slate and lime are plentiful. Fisheries, chiefly of lobster, oyster
(Courseulles), herring and mackerel, are prosecuted. Coal, timber,
grain, salt-fish and cement are among the imports; exports
include iron, dairy products and sand. Caen and Honfleur are
the most important commercial ports. There is a canal 9 m. in
length from Caen to Ouistreham on the coast. The department
is served by the Ouest-√ätat railway. It is divided into the six
arrondissements (38 cantons, 763 communes) of Caen, Falaise,
Bayeux, Vire, Lisieux and Pont l&rsquo;Ev√™que. Caen, the capital, is the
seat of a court of appeal and the centre of an <i>acad√©mie</i> (educational
division). The department forms the diocese of Bayeux,
in the ecclesiastical province of Rouen, and belongs to the region
of the III. army-corps. The other principal towns are Falaise,
Lisieux, Cond√©-sur-Noireau, Vire, Honfleur and Trouville (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>Amongst the great number of medieval churches which
the department possesses, the fine Gothic church of St. Pierre-sur-Dives
is second in importance only to those of Lisieux and
Bayeux; that of Norrey, a good example of the Norman-Gothic
style, and that of Tour-en-Bessin, in which Romanesque and
Gothic architecture are mingled, are of great interest. Fontaine-Henri
has a fine ch√¢teau of the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALVART, DENIS<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> (1540-1619), Flemish painter, was born at
Antwerp. After studying landscape-painting for some time in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
his native city he went to Bologna, where he perfected himself in
the anatomy of the human form under Prospero Fontana, and so
completely lost the mannerism of Flemish art that his paintings
appear to be the work of an Italian. From Bologna he went to
Rome, where he assisted Lorenzo Sabbatini (1533-1577) in his
works for the papal palace, and devoted much of his time to
copying and studying the works of Raphael. He ultimately
returned to Bologna and founded a school, of which the greatest
ornaments are Guido and Domenichino. His works are especially
admired for the power of grouping and colouring which they
display.</p>

meaning &ldquo;skull&rdquo; and representing the Hebrew Golgotha, the
name given to the scene of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion. The term &ldquo;a
Calvary&rdquo; is applied to a sculptured representation of the
Crucifixion, either inside a church, or adjoining one in the open
air. There are many examples of the latter in France, Italy
and Spain. Among the most important are the Sacro Monte
(1486) at Varallo in Piedmont, and those at Guimiliau (1581),
Plougastel (1602), St Thegonnec (1610), and Pleyben near

<p><span class="bold">CALVERLEY, CHARLES STUART<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> (1831-1884), English poet
and wit, and the literary father of what may be called the
university school of humour, was born at Martley in Worcestershire
on the 22nd of December 1831. His father, the Rev. Henry
Blayds, resumed in 1852 the old family name of Calverley, which
his grandfather had exchanged for Blayds in 1807. It was as
Charles Stuart Blayds that most of the son&rsquo;s university distinctions
were attained. He went up to Balliol from Harrow in 1850,
and was soon known in Oxford as the most daring and most
high-spirited undergraduate of his time. He was a universal
favourite, a delightful companion, a brilliant scholar and the
playful enemy of all &ldquo;dons.&rdquo; In 1851 he won the Chancellor&rsquo;s
prize for Latin verse, and it is said that the entire exercise was
written in an afternoon, when his friends had locked him into his
rooms, declining to let him out till he had finished what they were
confident would prove the prize poem. A year later he took his
name off the books, to avoid the consequences of a college
escapade, and migrated to Christ&rsquo;s College, Cambridge. Here he
was again successful in Latin verse, and remains the unique
example of an undergraduate who has won the Chancellor&rsquo;s prize
at both universities. In 1856 he took second place in the first
class in the Classical Tripos. He was elected fellow of Christ&rsquo;s
(1858), published <i>Verses and Translations</i> in 1862, and was called
to the bar in 1865. Owing to an accident while skating he was
prevented from following up a professional career, and during
the last years of his life he was an invalid. His <i>Translations into
English and Latin</i> appeared in 1866; his <i>Theocritus translated into
English Verse</i> in 1869; <i>Fly Leaves</i> in 1872; and <i>Literary Remains</i>
in 1885. He died on the 17th of February 1884. Calverley was
one of the most brilliant men of his day; and, had he enjoyed
health, might have achieved distinction in any career he chose.
Constitutionally indolent, he was endowed with singular gifts in
every department of culture; he was a scholar, a musician, an
athlete and a brilliant talker. What is left us marks only a small
portion of his talent, but his sparkling, dancing verses, which have
had many clever imitators, are still without a rival in their own
line. His humour was illumined by good nature; his satire was
keen but kind; his laughter was of that human sort which is often
on the verge of tears. Imbued with the classical spirit, he introduced
into the making of light verse the polish and elegance of the
great masters, and even in its most whimsical mood his verse is
raised to the level of poetry by the saving excellence of style.</p>

1836 till 1846 he lived in France, where, after a course of study at
Paris, he became manager of some chemical works, later acting as
assistant to M.E. Chevreul. On his return to England he settled
in Manchester as a consulting chemist, and was appointed
professor of chemistry at the Royal Institution in that city.
Devoting himself almost entirely to industrial chemistry, he
gave much attention to the manufacture of coal-tar products,

was probably born early in 1763 at Hampton, near London. He
was educated at Harrow, and at the age of fifteen entered the
army. In the following year he served with his regiment in
America, being present at the siege of Charleston, and serving
through the campaign of Lord Cornwallis which ended with the
surrender of Yorktown. From 1781 to 1783 he was a prisoner of
war. Returning to England in 1784, he next saw active service
in 1793-1794 in the Low Countries, where he was aide-de-camp to
the duke of York, and in 1795 was engaged on a confidential
mission to Brunswick and Berlin. In 1799, having already served
as deputy adjutant general, he was made adjutant general,
holding the post till 1818. In this capacity he effected many
improvements in the organization and discipline of the service.
He greatly improved the administration of the army medical and
hospital department, introduced regimental schools, developed
the two existing military colleges (since united at Sandhurst), and
was largely responsible for the founding of the Duke of York&rsquo;s
school, Chelsea. In recognition of his work as adjutant general
he was made a G.C.B. (1815), and, on retiring from office, received
a baronetcy (1818). In 1820 he was made governor of Chelsea
hospital. He died on the 3rd of September 1826, at Middle

(1906) 1967. It is situated on the Bay of Calvi, in a malarial
region, and is the port in Corsica nearest to France, being 109 m.
from Antibes; the harbour, however, is exposed to the east and
north-east winds. The modern town lies at the foot of a rock, on
which stands the old town with its steep rock-paved streets and
fortified walls, commanded by the Fort Muzello. Fishing is
carried on, and timber, oil, wine, lemons and other sub-tropical
fruits are exported to some extent. The most important buildings
are the old palace of the Genoese governor, used as barracks, and
the church (16th century), with the monument of the Baglioni

<p>Calvi was founded in the 13th century and in 1278 passed into
the hands of the Genoese. From that date it was remarkable for
its adherence to their side, especially in 1553 when it repulsed two
attacks of the united forces of the French and Turks. In recognition
thereof the Genoese senate caused the words <i>Civitas Calvi
semper fidelis</i> to be carved on the chief gate of the city, which still
preserves the inscription. In 1794 Calvi was captured by the
English, but it was retaken by the Corsicans in the following
year.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALVIN, JOHN<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (1500-1564), Swiss divine and reformer, was
born at Noyon, in Picardy, on the 10th of July 1509. His father,
G√©rard Cauvin or Calvin,<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> was a notary-apostolic and procurator-fiscal
for the lordship of Noyon, besides holding certain ecclesiastical
offices in connexion with that diocese. The name of his
mother was Jeanne le Franc; she was the daughter of an innkeeper
at Cambrai, who afterwards came to reside at Noyon.
G√©rard Cauvin was esteemed as a man of considerable sagacity
and prudence, and his wife was a godly and attractive lady. She
bore him five sons, of whom John was the second. By a second
wife there were two daughters.</p>

<p>Of Calvin&rsquo;s early years only a few notices remain. His father
destined him from the first for an ecclesiastical career, and paid
for his education in the household of the noble family of Hangest
de Montmor. In May 1521 he was appointed to a chaplaincy
attached to the altar of La G√©sine in the cathedral of Noyon, and
received the tonsure. The actual duties of the office were in such
cases carried out by ordained and older men for a fraction of the
stipend. The plague having visited Noyon, the young Hangests
were sent to Paris in August 1523, and Calvin accompanied them,
being enabled to do so by the income received from his benefice.
He lived with his uncle and attended as an out-student the
Coll√®ge de la Marche, at that time under the regency of Mathurin
Cordier, a man of character, learning and repute as a teacher,
who in later days followed his pupil to Switzerland, taught at
Neuch√¢tel, and died in Geneva in 1564. In dedicating to him his
<i>Commentary on the First Epistle to the Thessalonians,</i> as &ldquo;eximiae
pietatis et doctrinae viro,&rdquo; he declares that so had he been aided
by his instruction that whatever subsequent progress he had made
he only regarded as received from him, and &ldquo;this,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;I
wish to testify to posterity that if any utility accrue to any from
my writings they may acknowledge it as having in part flowed
from thee.&rdquo; From the Coll√®ge de la Marche he removed to the
Coll√®ge de Montaigu,<a name="fa2d" id="fa2d" href="#ft2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a> where the atmosphere was more ecclesiastical
and where he had for instructor a Spaniard who is
described as a man of learning and to whom Calvin was indebted
for some sound training in dialectics and the scholastic philosophy.
He speedily outstripped all his competitors in grammatical
studies, and by his skill and acumen as a student of philosophy,
and in the college disputations gave fruitful promise of that
consummate excellence as a reasoner in the department of
speculative truth which he afterwards displayed. Among his
friends were the Hangests (especially Claude), Nicolas and
Michel Cop, sons of the king&rsquo;s Swiss physician, and his own
kinsman Pierre Robert, better known as Oliv√©tan. Such friendships
testify both to the worth and the attractiveness of his
character, and contradict the old legend that he was an unsociable
misanthrope. Pleased with his success, the canons at Noyon
gave him the curacy of St Martin de Marteville in September
1527. After holding this preferment for nearly two years, he
exchanged it in July 1529 for the cure of Pont L&rsquo;√âv√™que, a village
near to Noyon, and the place to which his father originally belonged. He
appears to have been not a little elated by his early promotion, and
although not ordained, he preached several sermons to the people. But
though the career of ecclesiastical preferment was thus early opened to
him, Calvin was destined not to become a priest. A change came over the
mind both of his father and himself respecting his future career. G√©rard
Cauvin began to suspect that he had not chosen the most lucrative
profession for his son, and that the law offered to a youth of his
talents and industry a more promising sphere.<a name="fa3d" id="fa3d" href="#ft3d"><span class="sp">3</span></a> He was also now out of
favour with the cathedral chapter at Noyon. It is said also that John
himself, on the advice of his relative, Pierre Robert Oliv√©tan, the
first translator of the Bible into French, had begun to study the
Scriptures and to dissent from the Roman worship. At any rate he readily
complied with his father&rsquo;s suggestion, and removed from Paris to Orleans
(March 1528) in order to study law under Pierre Taisan de l&rsquo;Etoile, the
most distinguished jurisconsult of his day. The university atmosphere
here was less ascetic than at Paris, but Calvin&rsquo;s ardour knew no
slackening, and such was his progress in legal knowledge that he was
frequently called upon to lecture, in the absence of one or other of the
regular staff. Other studies, however, besides those of law occupied him
while in this city, and moved by the humanistic spirit of the age he
eagerly developed his classical knowledge. &ldquo;By protracted vigils,&rdquo; says
Beza, &ldquo;he secured indeed a solid erudition and an excellent memory; but
it is probable he at the same time sowed the seeds of that disease
(dyspepsia) which occasioned him various illnesses in after life, and at
last brought upon him premature death.&rdquo;<a name="fa4d" id="fa4d" href="#ft4d"><span class="sp">4</span></a> His friends here were
Melchior Wolmar, a German schoolmaster and a man of exemplary
scholarship and character, Fran√ßois Daniel, Francois de Connam and
Nicolas Duchemin; to these his earliest letters were written.</p>

<p>From Orleans Calvin went to Bourges in the autumn of 1529 to continue
his studies under the brilliant Italian, Andrea Alciati (1492-1550),
whom Francis I. had invited into France and settled as a professor of
law in that university. His friend Daniel went with him, and Wolmar
followed a year later. By Wolmar Calvin was taught Greek, and introduced
to the study of the New Testament in the original, a service which he
gratefully acknowledges in one of his printed works.<a name="fa5d" id="fa5d" href="#ft5d"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The conversation
of Wolmar may also have been of use to him in his consideration of the
doctrines of the Reformation, which were now beginning to be widely
diffused through France. Twelve years had elapsed since Luther had
published his theses against indulgences&mdash;twelve years of intense
excitement and anxious discussion, not in Germany only, but in almost
all the adjacent countries. In France there had not been as yet any
overt revolt against the Church of Rome, but multitudes were in sympathy
with any attempt to improve the church by education, by purer morals, by
better preaching and by a return to the primitive and uncorrupted faith.
Though we cannot with Beza regard Calvin at this time as a centre of
Protestant activity, he may well have preached at Ligni√®res as a
reformatory Catholic of the school of Erasmus. Calvin&rsquo;s own record of
his &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; is so scanty and devoid of chronological data that it
is extremely difficult to trace his religious development with any
certainty. But it seems probable that at least up to 1532 he was far
more concerned about classical scholarship than about religion.</p>

<p>His residence at Bourges was cut short by the death of his father in May
1531. Immediately after this event he went to Paris, where the &ldquo;new
learning&rdquo; was now at length ousting the medieval scholasticism from the
university. He lodged in the Coll√®ge Fortet, reading Greek with Pierre
Dan√®s and beginning Hebrew with Fran√ßois Vatable. It was at this time
(April 1532) that Calvin issued his first publication, a commentary in
Latin on Seneca&rsquo;s tract <i>De Clementia</i>. This book he published at his own
cost, and dedicated to Claude Hangest, abbot of St √âloi, a member of the
de Montmor family, with whom Calvin had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
brought up. It was formerly thought that Calvin published this
work with a view to influence the king to put a stop to the attacks
on the Protestants, but there is nothing in the treatise itself or in
the commentary to favour this opinion.</p>

<p>Soon after the publication of his first book Calvin returned
to Orleans, where he stayed for a year, perhaps again reading
law, and still undecided as to his life&rsquo;s work. He visited Noyon
in August 1533, and by October of the same year was settled
again in Paris. Here and now his destiny became certain. The
conservative theology was becoming discredited, and humanists
like Jacques Lef√®vre of √âtaples (Faber Stapulensis) and G√©rard
Roussel were favoured by the court under the influence of
Margaret of Angoul√™me, queen of Navarre and sister of Francis I.
Calvin&rsquo;s old friend, Nicolas Cop, had just been elected rector of
the university and had to deliver an oration according to custom
in the church of the Mathurins, on the feast of All Saints. The
oration (certainly influenced but hardly composed by Calvin)
was in effect a defence of the reformed opinions, especially of
the doctrine of justification by faith alone. It is to the period
between April 1532 and November 1533, and in particular to
the time of his second sojourn at Orleans, that we may most
fittingly assign the great change in Calvin which he describes
(<i>Praef. ad Psalmos</i>; opera xxxi. 21-24) as his &ldquo;sudden conversion&rdquo;
and attributes to direct divine agency. It must have
been at least after his <i>Commentary on Seneca&rsquo;s De Clementia</i>
that his heart was &ldquo;so subdued and reduced to docility that in
comparison with his zeal for true piety he regarded all other
studies with indifference, though not entirely forsaking them.
Though himself a beginner, many flocked to him to learn the
pure doctrine, and he began to seek some hiding-place and means
of withdrawal from people.&rdquo; This indeed was forced upon him,
for Cop&rsquo;s address was more than the conservative party could
bear, and Cop, being summoned to appear before the parlement
of Paris, found it necessary, as he failed to secure the support
either of the king, or of the university, to make his escape to
Basel. An attempt was at the same time made to seize Calvin,
but, being forewarned of the design by his friends, he also made
his escape. His room in the Coll√®ge Fortet, however, was
searched, and his books and papers seized, to the imminent
peril of some of his friends, whose letters were found in his
repositories. He went to Noyon, but, proceedings against him
being dropped, soon returned to Paris. But desiring both
security and solitude for study he left the city again about New
Year of 1534 and became the guest of Louis du Tillet, a canon of
the cathedral, at Angoul√™me, where at the request of his host he
prepared some short discourses, which were circulated in the
surrounding parishes, and read in public to the people. Here, too
in du Tillet&rsquo;s splendid library, he began the studies which resulted
in his great work, the <i>Institutes</i>, and paid a visit to N√©rac, where
the venerable Lef√®vre, whose revised translation of the Bible
into French was published about this time, was spending his last
years under the kindly care of Margaret of Navarre.</p>

<p>Calvin was now nearly twenty-five years of age, and in the
ordinary way would have been ordained to the priesthood. Up
till this time his work for the evangelical cause was not so much
that of the public preacher or reformer as that of the retiring
but influential scholar and adviser. Now, however, he had to
decide whether, like Roussel and other of his friends, he should
strive to combine the new doctrines with a position in the old
church, or whether he should definitely break away from Rome.
His mind was made up, and on the 4th of May he resigned
his chaplaincy at Noyon and his rectorship at Pont l&rsquo;√âv√™que.
Towards the end of the same month he was arrested and suffered
two short terms of imprisonment, the charges against him
being not strong enough to be pressed. He seems to have
gone next to Paris, staying perhaps with √âtienne de la
Forge, a Protestant merchant who suffered for his faith in
February 1535. To this time belongs the story of the proposed
meeting between Calvin and the Spanish reformer Servetus.
Calvin&rsquo;s movements at this time are difficult to trace, but he
visited both Orleans and Poitiers, and each visit marked a stage
in his development.</p>

<p>The Anabaptists of Germany had spread into France, and
were disseminating many wild and fanatical opinions among
those who had seceded from the Church of Rome. Among other
notions which they had imbibed was that of a sleep of the soul
after death. To Calvin this notion appeared so pernicious that
he composed a treatise in refutation of it, under the title of
<i>Psychopannychia</i>. The preface to this treatise is dated Orleans
1534, but it was not printed till 1542. In it he chiefly dwells
upon the evidence from Scripture in favour of the belief that the
soul retains its intelligent consciousness after its separation from
the body&mdash;passing by questions of philosophical speculation, as
tending on such a subject only to minister to an idle curiosity.
At Poitiers Calvin gathered round him a company of cultured
and gentle men whom in private intercourse he influenced
considerably. Here too in a grotto near the town he for the first
time celebrated the communion in the Evangelical Church of
France, using a piece of the rock as a table.</p>

<p>The year 1534 was thus decisive for Calvin. From this time
forward his influence became supreme, and all who had accepted
the reformed doctrines in France turned to him for counsel and
instruction, attracted not only by his power as a teacher, but
still more, perhaps because they saw in him so full a development
of the Christian life according to the evangelical model.
Renan, no prejudiced judge, pronounces him &ldquo;the most Christian
man of his time,&rdquo; and attributes to this his success as a reformer.
Certain it is that already he had become conspicuous as a prophet
of the new religion; his life was in danger, and he was obliged to
seek safety in flight. In company with his friend Louis du
Tillet, whom he had again gone to Angoul√™me to visit, he set out
for Basel. On their way they were robbed by one of their servants,
and it was only by borrowing ten crowns from their other
servant that they were enabled to get to Strassburg, and thence
to Basel. Here Calvin was welcomed by the band of scholars
and theologians who had conspired to make that city the Athens
of Switzerland, and especially by Oswald Myconius, the chief
pastor, Pierre Viret and Heinrich Bullinger. Under the aupices
and guidance of Sebastian M√ºnster, Calvin now gave himself to
the study of Hebrew.</p>

<p>Francis I., desirous to continue the suppression of the Protestants
but anxious, because of his strife with Charles V., not to
break with the Protestant princes of Germany, instructed his
ambassador to assure these princes that it was only against
Anabaptists, and other parties who called in question all civil
magistracy, that his severities were exercised. Calvin, indignant
at the calumny which was thus cast upon the reformed party in
France, hastily prepared for the press his <i>Institutes of the Christian
Religion</i>, which he published &ldquo;first that I might vindicate from
unjust affront my brethren whose death was precious in the sight
of the Lord, and, next, that some sorrow and anxiety should move
foreign peoples, since the same sufferings threatened many.&rdquo;
The work was dedicated to the king, and Calvin says he wrote it
in Latin that it might find access to the learned in all lands.<a name="fa6d" id="fa6d" href="#ft6d"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
Soon after it appeared he set about translating it into French, as
he himself attests in a letter dated October 1536. This sets at
rest a question, at one time much agitated, whether the book
appeared first in French or in Latin. The earliest French edition
known is that of 1540, and this was after the work had been much
enlarged, and several Latin editions had appeared. In its first
form the work consisted of only six chapters, and was intended
merely as a brief manual of Christian doctrine. The chapters
follow a traditional scheme of religious teaching: (1) The Law,
(as in the Ten Words), (2) Faith (as in the Apostles&rsquo; Creed)
(3) Prayer, (4) the Sacraments; to these were added (5) False
Sacraments, (6) Christian liberty, ecclesiastical power and civil
administration. The closing chapters of the work are more
polemical than the earlier ones. His indebtedness to Luther is
of course great, but his spiritual kinship with Martin Bucer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>
Strassburg is even more marked. Something also he owed to
Scotus and other medieval schoolmen. The book appeared
anonymously, the author having, as he himself says, nothing in
view beyond furnishing a statement of the faith of the persecuted
Protestants, whom he saw cruelly cut to pieces by impious and
perfidious court parasites.<a name="fa7d" id="fa7d" href="#ft7d"><span class="sp">7</span></a> In this work, though produced when
the author was only twenty-six years of age, we find a complete
outline of the Calvinist theological system. In none of the later
editions, nor in any of his later works do we find reason to believe
that he ever changed his views on any essential point from what
they were at the period of its first publication. Such an instance
of maturity of mind and of opinion at so early an age would be
remarkable under any circumstances; but in Calvin&rsquo;s case it is
rendered peculiarly so by the shortness of the time which had
elapsed since he gave himself to theological studies. It may be
doubted also if the history of literature presents us with another
instance of a book written at so early an age, which has exercised
such a prodigious influence upon the opinions and practices both
of contemporaries and of posterity.</p>

<p>After a short visit (April 1536) to the court of Ren√©e, duchess
of Ferrara (cousin to Margaret of Navarre), which at that time
afforded an asylum to several learned and pious fugitives from
persecution, Calvin returned through Basel to France to arrange
his affairs before finally taking farewell of his native country.
His intention was to settle at Strassburg or Basel, and to devote
himself to study. But being unable, in consequence of the war
between Francis I. and Charles V., to reach Strassburg by the
ordinary route, he with his younger brother Antoine and his
half-sister Marie journeyed to Lyons and so to Geneva, making
for Basel. In Geneva his progress was arrested, and his resolution
to pursue the quiet path of studious research was dispelled by
what he calls the &ldquo;formidable obtestation&rdquo; of Guillaume Farel.<a name="fa8d" id="fa8d" href="#ft8d"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
After many struggles and no small suffering, this energetic spirit
had succeeded in planting the evangelical standard at Geneva;
and anxious to secure the aid of such a man as Calvin, he entreated
him on his arrival to relinquish his design of going farther, and to
devote himself to the work in that city. Calvin at first declined,
alleging as an excuse his need of securing more time for personal
improvement, but ultimately, believing that he was divinely
called to this task and that &ldquo;God had stretched forth His hand
upon me from on high to arrest me,&rdquo; he consented to remain at
Geneva. He hurried to Basel, transacted some business, and
returned to Geneva in August 1536. He at once began to expound
the epistles of St Paul in the church of St Pierre, and after
about a year was also elected preacher by the magistrates with
the consent of the people, an office which he would not accept
until it had been repeatedly pressed upon him. His services
seem to have been rendered for some time gratuitously, for in
February 1537 there is an entry in the city registers to the effect
that six crowns had been voted to him, &ldquo;since he has as yet
hardly received anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Calvin was in his twenty-eighth year when he was thus
constrained to settle at Geneva; and in this city the rest of his
life, with the exception of a brief interval, was spent. The post
to which he was thus called was not an easy one. Though the
people of Geneva had cast off the obedience of Rome, it was
largely a political revolt against the duke of Savoy, and they were
still (says Beza) &ldquo;but very imperfectly enlightened in divine
knowledge; they had as yet hardly emerged from the filth of the
papacy.&rdquo;<a name="fa9d" id="fa9d" href="#ft9d"><span class="sp">9</span></a> This laid them open to the incursions of those
fanatical teachers, whom the excitement attendant upon the
Reformation had called forth, and who hung mischievously upon
the rear of the reforming body. To obviate the evils thence
resulting, Calvin, in union with Farel, drew up a condensed
statement of Christian doctrine consisting of twenty-one articles.
This the citizens were summoned, in parties of ten each, to
profess and swear to as the confession of their faith&mdash;a process
which, though not in accordance with modern notions of the best
way of establishing men in the faith, was gone through, Calvin
tells us, &ldquo;with much satisfaction.&rdquo; As the people took this oath
in the capacity of <i>citizens</i>, we may see here the basis laid for that
theocratic system which subsequently became peculiarly characteristic
of the Genevan polity. Deeply convinced of the importance
of education for the young, Calvin and his coadjutors were
solicitous to establish schools throughout the city, and to enforce
on parents the sending of their children to them; and as he had
no faith in education apart from religious training, he drew up a
catechism of Christian doctrine which the children had to learn
whilst they were receiving secular instruction. Of the troubles
which arose from fanatical teachers, the chief proceeded from
the efforts of the Anabaptists; a public disputation was held on
the 16th and 17th of March 1537, and so excited the populace
that the Council of Two Hundred stopped it, declared the
Anabaptists vanquished and drove them from the city. About
the same time also, the peace of Calvin and his friends was much
disturbed and their work interrupted by Pierre Caroli, another
native of northern France, who, though a man of loose principle
and belief, had been appointed chief pastor at Lausanne and was
discrediting the good work done by Pierre Viret in that city.
Calvin went to Viret&rsquo;s aid and brought Caroli before the commissioners
of Bern on a charge of advocating prayers for the dead
as a means of their earlier resurrection. Caroli brought a
counter-charge against the Geneva divines of Sabellianism and
Arianism, because they would not enforce the Athanasian creed,
and had not used the words &ldquo;Trinity&rdquo; and &ldquo;Person&rdquo; in the
confession they had drawn up. It was a struggle between the
thoroughgoing humanistic reformer who drew his creed solely
from the &ldquo;word of God&rdquo; and the merely semi-Protestant
reformer who looked on the old creed as a priceless heritage. In
a synod held at Bern the matter was fully discussed, when a
verdict was given in favour of the Geneva divines, and Caroli
deposed from his office and banished. He returned to France,
rejoined the Roman communion and spent the rest of his life in
passing to and from the old faith and the new. Thus ended an
affair which seems to have occasioned Calvin much more uneasiness
than the character of his assailant, and the manifest falsehood
of the charge brought against him, would seem to justify.
Two brief anti-Romanist tracts, one entitled <i>De fugiendis
impiorum sacris,</i> the other <i>De sacerdotio papali abjiciendo,</i> were
also published early in this year.</p>

<p>Hardly was the affair of Caroli settled, when new and severer
trials came upon the Genevan Reformers. The austere simplicity
of the ritual which Farel had introduced, and to which
Calvin had conformed; the strictness with which the ministers
sought to enforce not only the laws of morality, but certain
sumptuary regulations respecting the dress and mode of living
of the citizens; and their determination in spiritual matters
and ecclesiastical ceremonies not to submit to the least dictation
from the civil power, led to violent dissensions. Amidst much
party strife Calvin perhaps showed more youthful impetuosity
than experienced skill. He and his colleagues refused to administer
the sacrament in the Bernese form, <i>i.e.</i> with unleavened
bread, and on Easter Sunday, 1538, declined to do so at all
because of the popular tumult. For this they were banished
from the city. They went first to Bern, and soon after to
Z√ºrich, where a synod of the Swiss pastors had been convened.
Before this assembly they pleaded their cause, and stated what
were the points on which they were prepared to insist as needful
for the proper discipline of the church. They declared that they
would yield in the matter of ceremonies so far as to employ unleavened
bread in the eucharist, to use fonts in baptism, and to
allow festival days, provided the people might pursue their
ordinary avocations after public service. These Calvin regarded
as matters of indifference, provided the magistrates did
not make them of importance, by seeking to enforce them; and
he was the more willing to concede them, because he hoped
thereby to meet the wishes of the Bernese brethren whose
ritual was less simple than that established by Farel at Geneva.
But he and his colleagues insisted, on the other hand that for the
proper maintenance of discipline, there should be a division of
parishes&mdash;that excommunications should be permitted, and
should be under the power of elders chosen by the council, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
conjunction with the clergy&mdash;that order should be observed in
the admission of preachers&mdash;and that only the clergy should
officiate in ordination by the laying on of hands. It was proposed
also, as conducive to the welfare of the church, that the sacrament
of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper should be administered more frequently, at
least once every month, and that congregational singing of
psalms should be practised in the churches. On these terms the
synod interceded with the Genevese to restore their pastors;
but through the opposition of some of the Bernese (especially
Peter Kuntz, the pastor of that city) this was frustrated, and a
second edict of banishment was the only response.</p>

<p>Calvin and Farel betook themselves, under these circumstances,
to Basel, where they soon after separated, Farel to go to Neuch√¢tel
and Calvin to Strassburg. At the latter place Calvin
resided till the autumn of 1541, occupying himself partly in
literary exertions, partly as a preacher and especially an organizer
in the French church, and partly as a lecturer on theology.
These years were not the least valuable in his experience. In
1539 he attended Charles V.&rsquo;s conference on Christian reunion at
Frankfort as the companion of Bucer, and in the following year
he appeared at Hagenau and Worms, as the delegate from the
city of Strassburg. He was present also at the diet at Regensburg,
where he deepened his acquaintance with Melanchthon,
and formed with him a friendship which lasted through life. He
also did something to relieve the persecuted Protestants of
France. It is to this period of his life that we owe a revised and
enlarged form of his <i>Institutes</i>, his <i>Commentary on the Epistle to
the Romans</i>, and his <i>Tract on the Lord&rsquo;s Supper</i>. Notwithstanding
his manifold engagements, he found time to attend to the
tenderer affections; for it was during his residence at Strassburg
that he married, in August 1540, Idelette de Bure, the
widow of one Jean Stordeur of Li√©ge, whom he had converted
from Anabaptism. In her Calvin found, to use his own words,
&ldquo;the excellent companion of his life,&rdquo; a &ldquo;precious help&rdquo; to him
amid his manifold labours and frequent infirmities. She died in
1549, to the great grief of her husband, who never ceased to
mourn her loss. Their only child Jacques, born on the 28th of
July 1542, lived only a few days.</p>

<p>During Calvin&rsquo;s absence disorder and irreligion had prevailed
in Geneva. An attempt was made by Cardinal Jacopo Sadoleto
(1477-1547), bishop of Carpentras, to take advantage of this so
as to restore the papal supremacy in that district; but this
design Calvin, at the request of the Bernese authorities, who had
been consulted by those of Geneva, completely frustrated, by
writing such a reply to the letter which the bishop had addressed
to the Genevese, as constrained him to desist from all further
efforts. The letter had more than a local or temporary reference.
It was a popular yet thoroughgoing defence of the whole Protestant
position, perhaps the best apologia for the Reformation that
was ever written. He seems also to have kept up his connexion
with Geneva by addressing letters of counsel and comfort to the
faithful there who continued to regard him with affection. It
was whilst he was still at Strassburg that there appeared at
Geneva a translation of the Bible into French, bearing Calvin&rsquo;s
name, but in reality only revised and corrected by him from the
version of Oliv√©tan. Meanwhile the way was opening for his
return. Those who had driven him from the city gradually
lost power and office. Farel worked unceasingly for his recall.
After much hesitation, for Strassburg had strong claims, he
yielded and returned to Geneva, where he was received with
the utmost enthusiasm (September 13, 1541). He entered upon
his work with a firm determination to carry out those reforms
which he had originally purposed, and to set up in all its integrity
that form of church polity which he had carefully matured
during his residence at Strassburg. He now became the sole
directive spirit in the church at Geneva. Farel was retained
by the Neuch√¢telois, and Viret, soon after Calvin&rsquo;s return, removed
to Lausanne. His duties were thus rendered exceedingly
onerous, and his labour became excessive. Besides preaching
every day in each alternate week, he taught theology three days
in the week, attended weekly meetings of his consistory, read
the Scriptures once a week in the congregation, carried on an
extensive correspondence on a multiplicity of subjects, prepared
commentaries on the books of Scripture, and was engaged
repeatedly in controversy with the opponents of his opinions.
&ldquo;I have not time,&rdquo; he writes to a friend, &ldquo;to look out of my
house at the blessed sun, and if things continue thus I shall
forget what sort of appearance it has. When I have settled my
usual business, I have so many letters to write, so many questions
to answer, that many a night is spent without any offering of
sleep being brought to nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is only necessary here to sketch the leading events of
Calvin&rsquo;s life after his return to Geneva. He recodified the
Genevan laws and constitution, and was the leading spirit in the
negotiations with Bern that issued in the treaty of February
1544. Of the controversies in which he embarked, one of the
most important was that in which he defended his doctrine
concerning predestination and election. His first antagonist on
this head was Albert Pighius, a Romanist, who, resuming the
controversy between Erasmus and Luther on the freedom of the
will, violently attacked Calvin for the views he had expressed
on that subject. Calvin replied to him in a work published
in 1543, in which he defends his own opinions at length, both
by general reasonings and by an appeal to both Scripture
and the Fathers, especially Augustine. So potent were his
reasonings that Pighius, though owing nothing to the gentleness
or courtesy of Calvin, was led to embrace his views. A still more
vexatious and protracted controversy on the same subject arose
in 1551. Jerome Hermes Bolsec, a Carmelite friar, having
renounced Romanism, had fled from France to Veigy, a village
near Geneva, where he practised as a physician. Being a zealous
opponent of predestinarian views, he expressed his criticisms
of Calvin&rsquo;s teaching on the subject in one of the public conferences
held each Friday. Calvin replied with much vehemence,
and brought the matter before the civil authorities. The council
were at a loss which course to take; not that they doubted which
of the disputants was right, for they all held by the views of
Calvin, but they were unable to determine to what extent and
in which way Bolsec should be punished for his heresy. The
question was submitted to the churches at Basel, Bern, Z√ºrich
and Neuch√¢tel, but they also, to Calvin&rsquo;s disappointment, were
divided in their judgment, some counselling severity, others
gentle measures. In the end Bolsec was banished from Geneva;
he ultimately rejoined the Roman communion and in 1577
avenged himself by a particularly slanderous biography of
Calvin. Another painful controversy was that with S√©bastien
Castellio (1515-1563), a teacher in the Genevan school and a
scholar of real distinction. He wished to enter the preaching
ministry but was excluded by Calvin&rsquo;s influence because he had
criticized the inspiration of the Song of Solomon and the Genevan
interpretation of the clause &ldquo;he descended into hell.&rdquo; The
bitterness thus aroused developed into life-long enmity. During
all this time also the less strict party in the city and in the
council did not cease to harry the reformer.</p>

<p>But the most memorable of all the controversies in which
Calvin was engaged was that into which he was brought in 1553
with Michael Servetus (<i>q.v.</i>). After many wanderings, and
after having been condemned to death for heresy at Vienne,
whence he was fortunate enough to make his escape, Servetus
arrived in August 1553 at Geneva on his way to Naples. He was
recognized in church and soon after, at Calvin&rsquo;s instigation,
arrested. The charge of blasphemy was founded on certain
statements in a book published by him in 1553, entitled <i>Christianismi
Restitutio</i>, in which he animadverted on the Catholic
doctrine of the Trinity, and advanced sentiments strongly
savouring of Pantheism. The story of his trial is told elsewhere
(see art. <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Servetus</a></span>), but it must be noted here that the struggle
was something more than a doctrinal one. The cause of Servetus
was taken up by Calvin&rsquo;s Genevan foes headed by Philibert
Berthelier, and became a test of the relative strength of the rival
forces and of the permanence of Calvin&rsquo;s control. That Calvin
was actuated by personal spite and animosity against Servetus
himself may be open to discussion; we have his own express
declaration that, after Servetus was convicted, he used no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>
urgency that he should be put to death, and at their last interview
he told Servetus that he never had avenged private injuries,
and assured him that if he would repent it would not be his fault
if all the pious did not give him their hands.<a name="fa10d" id="fa10d" href="#ft10d"><span class="sp">10</span></a> There is the fact
also that Calvin used his endeavour to have the sentence which
had been pronounced against Servetus mitigated, death by
burning being regarded by him as an &ldquo;atrocity,&rdquo; for which he
sought to substitute death by the sword.<a name="fa11d" id="fa11d" href="#ft11d"><span class="sp">11</span></a> It can be justly
charged against Calvin in this matter that he took the initiative
in bringing on the trial of Servetus, that as his accuser he prosecuted
the suit against him with undue severity, and that he
approved the sentence which condemned Servetus to death.
When, however, it is remembered that the unanimous decision of
the Swiss churches and of the Swiss state governments was that
Servetus deserved to die; that the general voice of Christendom
was in favour of this; that even such a man as Melanchthon
affirmed the justice of the sentence;<a name="fa12d" id="fa12d" href="#ft12d"><span class="sp">12</span></a> that an eminent English
divine of the next age should declare the process against him
&ldquo;just and honourable,&rdquo;<a name="fa13d" id="fa13d" href="#ft13d"><span class="sp">13</span></a> and that only a few voices here and
there were at the time raised against it, many will be ready to
accept the judgment of Coleridge, that the death of Servetus was
not &ldquo;Calvin&rsquo;s guilt especially, but the common opprobrium of
all European Christendom.&rdquo;<a name="fa14d" id="fa14d" href="#ft14d"><span class="sp">14</span></a></p>

<p>Calvin was also involved in a protracted and somewhat vexing
dispute with the Lutherans respecting the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, which
ended in the separation of the evangelical party into the two great
sections of Lutherans and Reformed,&mdash;the former holding that in
the eucharist the body and blood of Christ are objectively and
consubstantially present, and so are actually partaken of by the
communicants, and the latter that there is only a virtual presence
of the body and blood of Christ, and consequently only a spiritual
participation thereof through faith. In addition to these
controversies on points of faith, he was for many years greatly
disquieted, and sometimes even endangered, by the opposition
offered by the libertine party in Geneva to the ecclesiastical
discipline which he had established there. His system of church
polity was essentially theocratic; it assumed that every member
of the state was also under the discipline of the church; and he
asserted that the right of exercising this discipline was vested
exclusively in the consistory or body of preachers and elders.
His attempts to carry out these views brought him into collision
both with the authorities and with the populace,&mdash;the latter
being not unnaturally restive under the restraints imposed upon
their liberty by the vigorous system of church discipline, and the
former being inclined to retain in their own hands a portion of
that power in things spiritual which Calvin was bent on placing
exclusively in the hands of the church rulers. His dauntless
courage, his perseverance, and his earnestness at length prevailed,
and he had the satisfaction, before he died, of seeing his favourite
system of church polity firmly established, not only at Geneva,
but in other parts of Switzerland, and of knowing that it had been
adopted substantially by the Reformers in France and Scotland.
The men whom he trained at Geneva carried his principles into
almost every country in Europe, and in varying degree these
principles did much for the cause of civil liberty.<a name="fa15d" id="fa15d" href="#ft15d"><span class="sp">15</span></a> Nor was it
only in religious matters that Calvin busied himself; nothing
was indifferent to him that concerned the welfare and good order
of the state or the advantage of its citizens. His work embraced
everything; he was consulted on every affair, great and small,
that came before the council,&mdash;on questions of law, police,
economy, trade, and manufactures, no less than on questions of
doctrine and church polity. To him the city owed her trade in
cloths and velvets, from which so much wealth accrued to her
citizens; sanitary regulations were introduced by him which
made Geneva the admiration of all visitors; and in him she
reverences the founder of her university. This institution was in
a sense Calvin&rsquo;s crowning work. It added religious education to
the evangelical preaching and the thorough discipline already
established, and so completed the reformer&rsquo;s ideal of a Christian
commonwealth.</p>

<p>Amidst these multitudinous cares and occupations, Calvin
found time to write a number of works besides those provoked by
the various controversies in which he was engaged. The most
numerous of these were of an exegetical character. Including
discourses taken down from his lips by faithful auditors, we have
from him expository comments or homilies on nearly all the
books of Scripture, written partly in Latin and partly in French.
Though naturally knowing nothing of the modern idea of a
progressive revelation, his judiciousness, penetration, and tact in
eliciting his author&rsquo;s meaning, his precision, condensation, and
concinnity as an expositor, the accuracy of his learning, the
closeness of his reasoning, and the elegance of his style, all unite
to confer a high value on his exegetical works. The series began
with <i>Romans</i> in 1540 and ended with <i>Joshua</i> in 1564. In 1558-1559
also, though in very ill health, he finally perfected the
Institutes.</p>

<p>The incessant and exhausting labours to which Calvin gave
himself could not but tell on his fragile constitution. Amid
many sufferings, however, and frequent attacks of sickness, he
manfully pursued his course; nor was it till his frail body, torn
by many and painful diseases&mdash;fever, asthma, stone, and gout,
the fruits for the most part of his sedentary habits and unceasing
activity&mdash;had, as it were, fallen to pieces around him, that his
indomitable spirit relinquished the conflict. In the early part of
the year 1564 his sufferings became so severe that it was manifest
his earthly career was rapidly drawing to a close. On the 6th of
February of that year he preached his last sermon, having with
great difficulty found breath enough to carry him through it. He
was several times after this carried to church, but never again
was able to take any part in the service. With his usual disinterestedness
he refused to receive his stipend, now that he was
no longer able to discharge the duties of his office. In the midst
of his sufferings, however, his zeal and energy kept him in
continual occupation; when expostulated with for such unseasonable
toil, he replied, &ldquo;Would you that the Lord should
find me idle when He comes?&rdquo; After he had retired from
public labours he lingered for some months, enduring the severest
agony without a murmur, and cheerfully attending to all the
duties of a private kind which his diseases left him strength to
discharge. On the 25th of April he made his will, on the 27th he
received the Little Council, and on the 28th the Genevan
ministers, in his sick-room; on the 2nd of May he wrote his last
letter&mdash;to his old comrade Farel, who hastened from Neuch√¢tel
to see him once again. He spent much time in prayer and died
quietly, in the arms of his faithful friend Theodore Beza, on the
evening of the 27th of May, in the fifty-fifth year of his age. The
next day he was buried without pomp &ldquo;in the common cemetery
called Plain-palais&rdquo; in a spot not now to be identified.</p>

<p>Calvin was of middle stature; his complexion was somewhat
pallid and dark; his eyes, to the latest clear and lustrous,
bespoke the acumen of his genius. He was sparing in his food
and simple in his dress; he took but little sleep, and was capable
of extraordinary efforts of intellectual toil. He had a most
retentive memory and a very keen power of observation. He
spoke without rhetoric, simply, directly, but with great weight.
He had many acquaintances but few close friends. His private
character was in harmony with his public reputation and position.
If somewhat severe and irritable, he was at the same time
scrupulously just, truthful, and steadfast; he never deserted a
friend or took an unfair advantage of an antagonist; and on
befitting occasions he could be cheerful and even facetious
among his intimates. &ldquo;God gave him,&rdquo; said the Little Council
after his death, &ldquo;a character of great majesty.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have been a
witness of him for sixteen years,&rdquo; says Beza, &ldquo;and I think I am
fully entitled to say that in this man there was exhibited to all an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>
example of the life and death of the Christian, such as it will not
be easy to depreciate, such as it will be difficult to emulate.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Though Calvin built his theology on the foundations laid by
earlier reformers, and especially by Luther and Bucer, his peculiar
gifts of learning, of logic and of style made him pre-eminently the
theologian of the new religion. The following may be regarded as
his characteristic tenets, though not all are peculiar to him.</p>

<p>The dominant thought is the infinite and transcendent sovereignty
of God, to know whom is the supreme end of human endeavour.
God is made known to man especially by the Scriptures, whose
writers were &ldquo;sure and authentic amanuenses of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;
To the Spirit speaking therein the Spirit-illumined soul of man
makes response. While God is the source of all good, man as a
sinner is guilty and corrupt. The first man was made in the image
and likeness of God, which not only implies man&rsquo;s superiority to all
other creatures, but indicates his original purity, integrity and
sanctity. From this state Adam fell, and in his fall involved the
whole human race descended from him. Hence depravity and
corruption, diffused through all parts of the soul, attach to all men,
and this first makes them obnoxious to the anger of God, and then
comes forth in works which the Scripture calls works of the flesh
(Gal. v. 19). Thus all are held vitiated and perverted in all parts
of their nature, and on account of such corruption deservedly condemned
before God, by whom nothing is accepted save righteousness
innocence, and purity. Nor is that a being bound for another&rsquo;s offence;
for when it is said that we through Adam&rsquo;s sin have become obnoxious
to the divine judgment, it is not to be taken as if we, being
ourselves innocent and blameless, bear the fault of his offence, but
that, we having been brought under a curse through his transgression,
he is said to have bound us. From him, however, not only
has punishment overtaken us, but a pestilence instilled from him
resides in us, to which punishment is justly due. Thus even infants,
whilst they bring their own condemnation with them from their
mother&rsquo;s womb, are bound not by another&rsquo;s but by their own fault.
For though they have not yet brought forth the fruits of their
iniquity, they have the seed shut up in them; nay, their whole nature
is a sort of seed of sin, therefore it cannot but be hateful and abominable
to God (<i>Instit.</i> bk. ii, ch. i. sect. 8).</p>

<p>To redeem man from this state of guilt, and to recover him from
corruption, the Son of God became incarnate, assuming man&rsquo;s nature
into union with His own, so that in Him were two natures in one
person. Thus incarnate He took on Him the offices of prophet,
priest and king, and by His humiliation, obedience and suffering unto
death, followed by His resurrection and ascension to heaven, He
has perfected His work and fulfilled all that was required in a
redeemer of men, so that it is truly affirmed that He has merited
for man the grace of salvation (bk. ii. ch. 13-17). But until a man
is in some way really united to Christ so as to partake of Him, the
benefits of Christ&rsquo;s work cannot be attained by him. Now it is by
the secret and special operation of the Holy Spirit that men are
united to Christ and made members of His body. Through faith,
which is a firm and certain cognition of the divine benevolence
towards us founded on the truth of the gracious promise in Christ,
men are by the operation of the Spirit united to Christ and are made
partakers of His death and resurrection, so that the old man is
crucified with Him and they are raised to a new life, a life of righteousness
and holiness. Thus joined to Christ the believer has life in
Him and knows that he is saved, having the witness of the Spirit
that he is a child of God, and having the promises, the certitude of
which the Spirit had before impressed on the mind, sealed by the
same Spirit on the heart (bk. iii. ch. 33-36). From faith proceeds
repentance, which is the turning of our life to God, proceeding from
a sincere and earnest fear of God, and consisting in the mortification
of the flesh and the old man within us and a vivification of the Spirit.
Through faith also the believer receives justification, his sins are
forgiven, he is accepted of God, and is held by Him as righteous,
the righteousness of Christ being imputed to him, and faith being
the instrument by which the man lays hold on Christ, so that with
His righteousness the man appears in God&rsquo;s sight as righteous.
This imputed righteousness, however, is not disjoined from real
personal righteousness, for regeneration and sanctification come
to the believer from Christ no less than justification; the two
blessings are not to be confounded, but neither are they to be disjoined.
The assurance which the believer has of salvation he
receives from the operation and witness of the Holy Spirit; but
this again rests on the divine choice of the man to salvation; and
this falls back on God&rsquo;s eternal sovereign purpose, whereby He has
predestined some to eternal life while the rest of mankind are
predestined to condemnation and eternal death. Those whom
God has chosen to life He effectually calls to salvation, and they
are kept by Him in progressive faith and holiness unto the end
(bk. iii. <i>passim</i>). The external means or aids by which God unites
men into the fellowship of Christ, and sustains and advances those
who believe, are the church and its ordinances, especially the sacraments.
The church universal is the multitude gathered from diverse
nations, which though divided by distance of time and place, agree
in one common faith, and it is bound by the tie of the same religion;
and wherever the word of God is sincerely preached, and the sacraments
are duly administered, according to Christ&rsquo;s institute, there
beyond doubt is a church of the living God (bk. iv. ch. 1, sect. 7-11).
The permanent officers in the church are pastors and teachers, to the
former of whom it belongs to preside over the discipline of the
church, to administer the sacraments, and to admonish and exhort
the members; while the latter occupy themselves with the exposition
of Scripture, so that pure and wholesome doctrine may be retained.
With them are to be joined for the government of the church certain
pious, grave and holy men as a senate in each church; and to others,
as deacons, is to be entrusted the care of the poor. The election of
the officers in a church is to be with the people, and those duly
chosen and called are to be ordained by the laying on of the hands
of the pastors (ch. 3, sect. 4-16). The sacraments are two&mdash;Baptism
and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. Baptism is the sign of initiation whereby
men are admitted into the society of the church and, being grafted
into Christ, are reckoned among the sons of God; it serves both
for the confirmation of faith and as a confession before men. The
Lord&rsquo;s Supper is a spiritual feast where Christ attests that He is the
life-giving bread, by which our souls are fed unto true and blessed
immortality. That sacred communication of His flesh and blood
whereby Christ transfuses into us His life, even as if it penetrated
into our bones and marrow, He in the Supper attests and seals;
and that not by a vain or empty sign set before us but there He
puts forth the efficacy of His Spirit whereby He fulfils what He
promises. In the mystery of the Supper Christ is truly exhibited
to us by the symbols of bread and wine; and so His body and blood,
in which He fulfilled all obedience for the obtaining of righteousness
for us, are presented. There is no such presence of Christ in the
Supper as that He is affixed to the bread or included in it or in any
way circumscribed; but whatever can express the true and substantial
communication of the body and blood of the Lord, which
is exhibited to believers under the said symbols of the Supper, is to
be received, and that not as perceived by the imagination only or
mental intelligence, but as enjoyed for the aliment of the eternal life
(bk. iv. ch. 15, 17).</p>

<p>The course of time has substantially modified many of these
positions. Even the churches which trace their descent from
Calvin&rsquo;s work and faith no longer hold in their entirety his views
on the magistrate as the preserver of church purity, the utter depravity
of human nature, the non-human character of the Bible,
the dealing of God with man. But his system had an immense
value in the history of Christian thought. It appealed to and
evoked a high order of intelligence, and its insistence on personal
individual salvation has borne worthy fruit. So also its insistence
on the chief end of man &ldquo;to know and do the will of God&rdquo; made
for the strenuous morality that helped to build up the modern
world. Its effects are most clearly seen in Scotland, in Puritan
England and in the New England states, but its influence was and
is felt among peoples that have little desire or claim to be called
Calvinist.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;The standard edition of Calvin&rsquo;s works is that
undertaken by the Strassburg scholars, J.W. Bauin, E. Cunitz,
E. Reuss, P. Lobstein, A. Erichson (59 vols., 1863-1900). The last
of these contains an elaborate bibliography which was also published
separately at Berlin in 1900. The bulk of the writings was published
in English by the Calvin Translation Society (48 vols., Edinburgh,
1843-1855); the <i>Institutes</i> have often been translated. The early
lives by Beza and Collodon are given in the collected editions.

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CALVINISTIC METHODISTS,<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> a body of Christians forming a
church of the Presbyterian order and claiming to be the only
denomination in Wales which is of purely Welsh origin. Its
beginnings may be traced to the labours of the Rev. Griffith
Jones (1684-1761), of Llanddowror, Carmarthenshire, whose
sympathy for the poor led him to set on foot a system of circulating
charity schools for the education of children. In striking
contrast to the general apathy of the clergy of the period,
Griffith Jones&rsquo;s zeal appealed to the public imagination, and his
powerful preaching exercised a widespread influence, many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>77</span>
travelling long distances in order to attend his ministry. There
was thus a considerable number of earnest people dispersed
throughout the country waiting for the rousing of the parish
clergy. An impressive announcement of the Easter Communion
Service, made by the Rev. Pryce Davies, vicar of Talgarth,
on the 30th of March 1735, was the means of awakening
Howell Harris (1714-1773) of Trevecca, and he immediately
began to hold services in his own house. He was soon invited to
do the same at the houses of others, and ended by becoming a
fiery itinerant preacher, stirring to the depths every neighbourhood
he visited. Griffith Jones, preaching at Llanddewi Brefi,
Cardiganshire&mdash;the place at which the Welsh Patron Saint,
David, first became famous&mdash;found Daniel Rowland (1713-1790),
curate of Llangeitho, in his audience, and his patronizing attitude
in listening drew from the preacher a personal supplication on his
behalf, in the middle of the discourse. Rowland was deeply
moved, and became an ardent apostle of the new movement.
Naturally a fine orator, his new-born zeal gave an edge to his
eloquence, and his fame spread abroad. Rowland and Harris
had been at work fully eighteen months before they met, at a
service in Devynock church, in the upper part of Breconshire.
The acquaintance then formed lasted to the end of Harris&rsquo;s life&mdash;an
interval of ten years excepted. Harris had been sent to
Oxford in the autumn of 1735 to &ldquo;cure him of his fanaticism,&rdquo;
but he left in the following February. Rowland had never been
to a university, but, like Harris, he had been well grounded in
general knowledge. About 1739 another prominent figure
appeared. This was Howell Davies of Pembrokeshire, whose
ministry was modelled on that of his master, Griffith Jones, but
with rather more clatter in his thunder.</p>

<p>In 1736, on returning home, Harris opened a school, Griffith
Jones supplying him with books from his charity. He also set up
societies, in accordance with the recommendations in Josiah
Wedgwood&rsquo;s little book on the subject; and these exercised a
great influence on the religious life of the people. By far the
most notable of Harris&rsquo;s converts was William Williams (1717-1791),
Pant y Celyn, the great hymn-writer of Wales, who while
listening to the revivalist preaching on a tombstone in the
graveyard of Talgarth, heard the &ldquo;voice of heaven,&rdquo; and was
&ldquo;apprehended as by a warrant from on high.&rdquo; He was ordained
deacon in the Church of England, 1740, but Whitefield recommended
him to leave his curacies and go into the highways and
hedges. On Wednesday and Thursday, January 5th and 6th,
1743, the friends of aggressive Christianity in Wales met at
Wadford, near Caerphilly, Glam., in order to organize their
societies. George Whitefield was in the chair. Rowland, Williams
and John Powell&mdash;afterwards of Llanmartin&mdash;(clergymen),
Harris, John Humphreys and John Cennick (laymen) were
present. Seven lay exhorters were also at the meetings; they
were questioned as to their spiritual experience and allotted
their several spheres; other matters pertaining to the new
conditions created by the revival were arranged. This is known
as the first Methodist Association&mdash;held eighteen months before
Johm Wesley&rsquo;s first conference (June 25th, 1744). Monthly
meetings covering smaller districts, were organized to consider
local matters, the transactions of which were to be reported to
the Quarterly Association, to be confirmed, modified, or rejected.
Exhorters were divided into two classes&mdash;public, who were
allowed to itinerate as preachers and superintend a number of
societies; private, who were confined to the charge of one or
two societies. The societies were distinctly understood to be
part of the established church, as Wedgwood&rsquo;s were, and every
attempt at estranging them therefrom was sharply reproved;
but persecution made their position anomalous. They did not
accept the discipline of the Church of England, so the plea of
conformity was a feeble defence; nor had they taken out licenses,
so as to claim the protection of the Toleration Act. Harris&rsquo;s
ardent loyalty to the Church of England, after three refusals
to ordain him, and his personal contempt for ill-treatment from
persecutors, were the only things that prevented separation.</p>

<p>A controversy on a doctrinal point&mdash;&ldquo;Did God die on
Calvary?&rdquo;&mdash;raged for some time, the principal disputants
being Rowland and Harris; and in 1751 it ended in an open
rupture, which threw the Connexion first into confusion and then
into a state of coma. The societies split up into Harrisites and
Rowlandites, and it was only with the revival of 1762 that the
breach was fairly repaired. This revival is a landmark in the
history of the Connexion. Williams of Pant y Celyn had just
published a little volume of hymns, the singing of which inflamed
the people. This led the bishop of St David&rsquo;s to suspend
Rowland&rsquo;s license, and Rowland had to confine himself to a
meeting-house at Llangeitho. Having been turned out of other
churches, he had leased a plot of land in 1759, anticipating the
final withdrawal of his license, in 1763, and a spacious building
was erected to which the people crowded from all parts on
Sacrament Sunday. Llangeitho became the Jerusalem of Wales;
and Rowland&rsquo;s popularity never waned until his physical powers
gave way. A notable event in the history of Welsh Methodism
was the publication in 1770, of a 4to annotated Welsh Bible by
the Rev. Peter Williams, a forceful preacher, and an indefatigable
worker, who had joined the Methodists in 1746, after being
driven from several curacies. It gave birth to a new interest in
the Scriptures, being the first definite commentary in the language.
A powerful revival broke out at Llangeitho in the spring of
1780, and spread to the south, but not to the north of Wales.
The ignorance of the people of the north made it very difficult
for Methodism to benefit from these manifestations, until the
advent of the Rev. Thomas Charles (1755-1814), who, having
spent five years in Somersetshire as curate of several parishes,
returned to his native land to marry Sarah Jones of Bala.
Failing to find employment in the established church, he joined
the Methodists in 1784. His circulating charity schools and
then his Sunday schools gradually made the North a new
country. In 1791 a revival began at Bala; and this, strange to
say, a few months after the Bala Association had been ruffled by
the proceedings which led to the expulsion of Peter Williams
from the Connexion, in order to prevent him from selling John
Canne&rsquo;s Bible among the Methodists, because of some Sabellian
marginal notes.</p>

<p>In 1790, the Bala Association passed &ldquo;Rules regarding the
proper mode of conducting the Quarterly Association,&rdquo; drawn
up by Charles; in 1801, Charles and Thomas Jones of Mold,
published (for the association) the &ldquo;Rules and Objects of the
Private Societies among the People called Methodists.&rdquo; About
1795, persecution led the Methodists to take the first step
towards separation from the Church of England. Heavy fines
made it impossible for preachers in poor circumstances to
continue without claiming the protection of the Toleration Act,
and the meeting-houses had to be registered as dissenting chapels.
In a large number of cases this had only been delayed by so constructing
the houses that they were used both as dwellings and
as chapels at one and the same time. Until 1811 the Calvinistic
Methodists had no ministers ordained by themselves; their
enormous growth in numbers and the scarcity of ministers to
administer the Sacrament&mdash;only three in North Wales, two of
whom had joined only at the dawn of the century&mdash;made the
question of ordination a matter of urgency. The South Wales
clergy who regularly itinerated were dying out; the majority of
those remaining itinerated but irregularly, and were most of them
against the change. The lay element, with the help of Charles and
a few other stalwarts, carried the matter through&mdash;ordaining
nine at Bala in June, and thirteen at Llandilo in August. In
1823, the <i>Confession of Faith</i> was published; it is based on the
<i>Westminster Confession</i> as &ldquo;Calvinistically construed,&rdquo; and
contains 44 articles. The Connexion&rsquo;s <i>Constitutional Deed</i> was
formally completed in 1826.</p>

<p>Thomas Charles had tried to arrange for taking over Trevecca
College when the trustees of the Countess of Huntingdon&rsquo;s
Connexion removed their seminary to Cheshunt in 1791; but the
Bala revival broke out just at the time, and, when things grew
quieter, other matters pressed for attention. A college had been
mooted in 1816, but the intended tutor died suddenly, and the
matter was for the time dropped. Candidates for the Connexional
ministry were compelled to shift for themselves until 1837,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span>
when Lewis Edwards (1809-1887) and David Charles (1812-1878)
opened a school for young men at Bala. North and South
alike adopted it as their college, the associations contributing a
hundred guineas each towards the education of their students.
In 1842, the South Wales Association opened a college at
Trevecca, leaving Bala to the North; the Rev. David Charles
became principal of the former, and the Rev. Lewis Edwards of
the latter. After the death of Dr Lewis Edwards, Dr. T.C.
Edwards resigned the principalship of the University College at
Aberystwyth to become head of Bala (1891), now a purely
theological college, the students of which were sent to the
university colleges for their classical training. In 1905 Mr David
Davies of Llandinam&mdash;one of the leading laymen in the Connexion&mdash;offered
a large building at Aberystwyth as a gift to the
denomination for the purpose of uniting North and South in one
theological college; but in the event of either association
declining the proposal, the other was permitted to take possession,
giving the association that should decline the option of joining at
a later time. The Association of the South accepted, and that of
the North declined, the offer; Trevecca College was turned into
a preparatory school on the lines of a similar institution set up at
Bala in 1891.</p>

<p>The missionary collections of the denomination were given
to the London Missionary Society from 1798 to 1840, when a
Connexional Society was formed; and no better instances of
missionary enterprise are known than those of the Khasia and
Jaintia Hills, and the Plains of Sylhet in N. India. There
has also been a mission in Brittany since 1842.</p>

<p>The constitution of the denomination (called in Welsh, &ldquo;Hen
Gorph,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the Old Body) is a mixture of Presbyterianism and
Congregationalism; each church manages its own affairs and
reports (1) to the district meeting, (2) to the monthly meeting,
the nature of each report determining its destination. The
monthly meetings are made up of all the officers of the churches
comprised in each, and are split up into districts for the purpose
of a more local co-operation of the churches. The monthly
meetings appoint delegates to the quarterly Associations, of
which all officers are members. The Associations of North and
South are distinct institutions, deliberating and determining
matters pertaining to them in their separate quarterly gatherings.
For the purpose of a fuller co-operation in matters common to
both, a general assembly (meeting once a year) was established
in 1864. This is a purely deliberative conclave, worked by
committees, and all its legislation has to be confirmed by the two
Associations before it can have any force or be legal. The
annual conference of the English churches of the denomination
has no legislative standing, and is meant for social and spiritual
intercourse and discussions.</p>

<p>In doctrine the church is Calvinistic, but its preachers are far
from being rigid in this particular, being warmly evangelical,
and, in general, distinctly cultured. The London degree largely
figures on the Connexional Diary; and now the Welsh degrees,
in arts and divinity, are being increasingly achieved. It is a
remarkable fact that every Welsh revival, since 1735, has broken
out among the Calvinistic Methodists. Those of 1735, 1762,
1780 and 1791 have been mentioned; those of 1817, 1832, 1859
and 1904-1905 were no less powerful, and their history is interwoven
with Calvinistic Methodism, the system of which is so
admirably adapted for the passing on of the torch. The ministerial
system is quite anomalous. It started in pure itineracy;
the pastorate came in very gradually, and is not yet in universal
acceptance. The authority of the pulpit of any individual church
is in the hands of the deacons; they ask the pastor to supply so
many Sundays a year&mdash;from twelve to forty, as the case may
be&mdash;and they then fill the remainder with any preacher they
choose. The pastor is paid for his pastoral work, and receives
his Sunday fee just as a stranger does; his Sundays from home
he fills up at the request of deacons of other churches, and it is a
breach of Connexional etiquette for a minister to apply for engagements,
no matter how many unfilled Sundays he may have.
Deacons and preachers make engagements seven or eight years
in advance. The Connexion provides for English residents
wherever required, and the English ministers are oftener in
their own pulpits than their Welsh brethren.</p>

<p>The Calvinistic Methodists form in some respects the strongest
church in Wales, and its forward movement, headed by Dr. John
Pugh of Cardiff, has brought thousands into its fold since its
establishment in 1891. Its Connexional Book Room, opened in
1891, yields an annual profit of from ¬£1600 to ¬£2000, the profits
being devoted to help the colleges and to establish Sunday
school libraries, etc. Its chapels in 1907 numbered 1641 (with
accommodation for 488,080), manses 229; its churches<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> numbered
1428, ministers 921, unordained preachers 318, deacons
6179; its Sunday Schools 1731, teachers 27,895, scholars 193,460,
communicants 189,164, total collections for religious purposes
¬£300,912. The statistics of the Indian Mission are equally
good: communicants 8027, adherents 26,787, missionaries 23,
native ministers (ordained) 15, preachers (not ordained) 60.</p>

<p>The Calvinistic Methodists are intensely national in sentiment
and aspirations, beyond all suspicion loyalists. They take a
great interest in social, political and educational matters, and are
prominent on public bodies. They support the Eisteddfod as the
promoter and inspirer of arts, letters and music, and are conspicuous
among the annual prize winners. They thus form a
living, democratic body, flexible and progressive in its movements,
yet with a sufficient proportion of conservatism both in religion
and theology to keep it sane and safe.</p>

born of a peasant family at Gorschleben in Thuringia on the
21st of February 1556. By the exercise of his musical talents
he earned money enough for the start, at Helmstadt, of an
university career, which the aid of a wealthy patron enabled him
to continue at Leipzig. He became director of the music-school
at Pforten in 1572, was transferred to Leipzig in the same
capacity in 1594, and retained this post until his death on the
24th of November 1615, despite the offers successively made to
him of mathematical professorships at Frankfort and Wittenberg.
In his <i>Opus Chronologicum</i> (Leipzig, 1605, 7th ed. 1685) he
expounded a system based on the records of nearly 300 eclipses.
An ingenious, though ineffective, proposal for the reform of the
calendar was put forward in his <i>Elenchus Calendarii Gregoriani</i>
(Frankfort, 1612); and he published a book on music, <i>Melodiae
condendae ratio</i> (Erfurt, 1592), still worth reading.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CALVO, CARLOS<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> (1824-1906), Argentine publicist and
historian, was born at Buenos Aires on the 26th of February
1824, and devoted himself to the study of the law. In 1860 he
was sent by the Paraguayan government on a special mission to
London and Paris. Remaining in France, he published in 1863
his <i>Derecho international teorico y practice de Europay America</i>, in
two volumes, and at the same time brought out a French version.
The book immediately took rank as one of the highest modern
authorities on the subject, and by 1887 the first French edition
had become enlarged to six volumes. Se√±or Calvo&rsquo;s next
publications were of a semi-historical character. Between 1862
and 1869 he published in Spanish and French his great collection
in fifteen volumes of the treaties and other diplomatic acts of the
South American republics, and between 1864 and 1875 his
<i>Annales historiques de la revolution de l&rsquo;Amerique latine</i>, in five
volumes. In 1884 he was one of the founders at the Ghent
congress of the <i>Institut de Droit International.</i> In the following
year he was Argentine minister at Berlin, and published his
<i>Dictionnaire du droit international public et priv√©</i> in that city.

W√ºrttemberg, on the Nagold, 34 m. S.W. of Stuttgart by rail.
Pop. (1905), 4943. It contains a Protestant and a Roman
Catholic Church, two schools, missionary institution, and a fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span>
public library. The industries include spinning and weaving
operations in wool and cotton. Carpets, cigars and leather are
also manufactured. The timber trade, chiefly with the Netherlands,
is important. The place is in favour as a health resort.</p>

<p>The name of Calw appears first in 1037. In the middle ages
the town was under the dominion of a powerful family of counts,
whose possessions finally passed to W√ºrttemberg in 1345. In
1634 the town was taken by the Bavarians, and in 1692 by

Pliny, 7¬Ω Roman m. from the sea, on the river Euenus. It was
said to have been founded by Calydon, son of Aetolus; to have
been the scene of the hunting, by Meleager and other heroes, of
the famous Calydonian boar, sent by Artemis to lay waste the
fields; and to have taken part in the Trojan war. In historical
times it is first mentioned (391 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) as in the possession of the
Achaeans, who retained it for twenty years, by the assistance of
the Lacedaemonian king, Agesilaus, notwithstanding the attacks
of the Arcarnanians. After the battle of Leuctra (371 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) it was
restored by Epaminondas to the Aetolians. In the time of
Pompey it was a town of importance; but Augustus removed
its inhabitants to Nicopolis, which he founded to commemorate
his victory at Actium (31 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>). The walls of Calydon are almost
certainly to be recognized in the Kastro of Kurtag√°. These
comprise a circuit of over 2 m., with one large gate and five
smaller ones, and are situated on a hill on the right or west bank
of the Euenus. Remains of large terrace walls outside the town
probably indicate the position of the temple of Artemis Laphria,
whose gold and ivory statue was transferred to Patras, together
probably with her ritual. This included a sacrifice in which all
kinds of beasts, wild and tame, were driven into a wooden pyre
and consumed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAM (C√ÉO), DIOGO<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> (fl. 1480-1486), Portuguese discoverer,
the first European known to sight and enter the Congo, and to
explore the West African coast between Cape St Catherine (2¬∞S.)
and Cape Cross (21¬∞ 50&prime; S.) almost from the equator to Walfish
Bay. When King John II. of Portugal revived the work of
Henry the Navigator, he sent out Cam (about midsummer (?)
1482) to open up the African coast still further beyond the
equator. The mouth of the Congo was now discovered (perhaps
in August 1482), and marked by a stone pillar (still existing, but
only in fragments) erected on Shark Point; the great river was
also ascended for a short distance, and intercourse was opened
with the natives. Cam then coasted down along the present
Angola (Portuguese West Africa), and erected a second pillar,
probably marking the termination of this voyage, at Cape Santa
Maria (the Monte Negro of these first visitors) in 13¬∞ 26&prime; S. He
certainly returned to Lisbon by the beginning of April 1484,
when John II. ennobled him, made him a <i>cavalleiro</i> of his household
(he was already an <i>escudeiro</i> or esquire in the same), and
granted him an annuity and a coat of arms (8th and 14th of
April 1484). That Cam, on his second voyage of 1483-1486, was
accompanied by Martin Behaim (as alleged on the latter&rsquo;s
Nuremberg globe of 1492) is very doubtful; but we know that
the explorer revisited the Congo and erected two more pillars
beyond the furthest of his previous voyage, the first at another
&ldquo;Monte Negro&rdquo; in 15¬∞ 41&prime; S., the second at Cape Cross in
21¬∞ 50&prime;, this last probably marking the end of his progress
southward. According to one authority (a legend on the 1489
map of Henricus Martellus Germanus), Cam died off Cape Cross;
but Jo√£o de Barros and others make him return to the Congo,
and take thence a native envoy to Portugal. The four pillars
set up by Cam on his two voyages have all been discovered
<i>in situ</i>, and the inscriptions on two of them from Cape Santa
Maria and Cape Cross, dated 1482 and 1485 respectively, are
still to be read and have been printed; the Cape Cross padr√£o is
now at Kiel (replaced on the spot by a granite facsimile); those
from the Congo estuary and the more southerly Monte Negro are
in the Museum of the Lisbon Geographical Society.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMACHO, JUAN FRANCISCO<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (1824-1896), Spanish statesman
and financier, was born in Cadiz in 1824. The first part of
his life was devoted to mercantile and financial pursuits at
Cadiz and then in Madrid, where he managed the affairs of and
liquidated a mercantile and industrial society to the satisfaction
and profit of the shareholders. In 1837 he became a captain in
the national militia, in 1852 Conservative deputy in the Cortes
for Alcoy, in 1853 secretary of congress, and was afterwards
elected ten times deputy, twice senator and life senator in
1877. Camacho took a prominent part in all financial debates
and committees, was offered a seat in the Mon cabinet of 1864,
and was appointed under-secretary of state finances in 1866
under Canovas and O&rsquo;Donnell. After the revolution of 1868 he
declined the post of minister of finance offered by Marshal
Serrano, but served in that capacity in 1872 and 1874 in Sagasta&rsquo;s
cabinets. When the restoration took place, Camacho sat in the
Cortes among the dynastic Liberals with Sagasta as leader, and
became finance minister in 1881 at a critical moment when
Spain had to convert, reduce, and consolidate her treasury
and other debts with a view to resuming payment of coupons.
Camacho drew up an excellent budget and collected taxation
with a decidedly unpopular vigour. A few years later Sagasta
again made him finance minister under the regency of Queen
Christina, but had to sacrifice him when public opinion very
clearly pronounced against his too radical financial reforms and
his severity in collection of taxes. He was for the same reasons
unsuccessful as a governor of the Tobacco Monopoly Company.
He then seceded from the Liberals, and during the last years of
his life he affected to vote with the Conservatives, who made him
governor of the Bank of Spain. He died in Madrid on the 23rd of
January 1896.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMALDULIANS,<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Camaldolese</span>, a religious order founded
by St Romuald. Born of a noble family at Ravenna <i>c.</i> 950, he
retired at the age of twenty to the Benedictine monastery of
S. Apollinare in Classe; but being strongly drawn to the eremitical
life, he went to live with a hermit in the neighbourhood of
Venice and then again near Ravenna. Here a colony of hermits
grew up around him and he became the superior. As soon as
they were established in their manner of life, Romuald moved to
another district and there formed a second settlement of hermits,
only to proceed in the same way to the establishment of other
colonies of hermits or &ldquo;deserts&rdquo; as they were called. In this
way during the course of his life Romuald formed a great number
of &ldquo;deserts&rdquo; throughout central Italy. His chief foundation
was at Camaldoli on the heights of the Tuscan Apennines not far
from Arezzo, in a vale snow-covered during half the year.
Romuald&rsquo;s idea was to reintroduce into the West the primitive
eremitical form of monachism, as practised by the first Egyptian
and Syrian monks. His monks dwelt in separate huts around the
oratory, and came together only for divine service and on certain
days for meals. The life was one of extreme rigour in regard to
food, clothing, silence and general observance. Besides the
hermits there were lay brothers to help in carrying out the field
work and rougher occupations. St Romuald and the early
Camaldolese exercised considerable influence on the religious
movements of their time; the emperors Otto III. and Henry II.
esteemed him highly and sought his advice on religious questions.
Disciples of St Romuald went on missions to the still heathen
parts of Russia, Poland and Prussia, where some of them suffered
martyrdom. In his extreme old age St Romuald with twenty-five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
of his monks started on a missionary expedition to Hungary,
but he was unable to accomplish the journey. He died in 1027.
After his death mitigations were gradually introduced into the
rule and manner of life; and in the monastery of St Michael in
Murano, Venice, the life became cenobitical. From that time to
the present day there have always been both eremitical and
cenobitical Camaldolese, the latter approximating to ordinary
Benedictine life. The Camaldolese spread all over Italy, and into
Germany, Poland and France. Camaldoli itself exists as a
&ldquo;desert,&rdquo; the primitive observance of the institute being strictly
maintained. There are a few other &ldquo;deserts,&rdquo; all in Italy,
except one in Poland; and there are about 90 hermits. The chief
monastery of the cenobitical Camaldolese is S. Gregorio on the
Caelian Hill in Rome; they number less than forty. Since the
11th century there have been Camaldolese nuns; at present there
are five nunneries with 150 nuns, all belonging to the cenobitical
branch of the order. The habit of the Camaldulians is white.</p>

French dancer, of Spanish descent, was born in Brussels on the
15th of April 1710. Her father, Ferdinand Joseph de Cupis,
earned a scanty living as violinist and dancing-master, and from
childhood she was trained for the stage. At ten years of age she
was given lessons by Mlle Fran√ßoise Pr√©vost (1680-1741), then
the first dancer at the Paris Op√©ra, and at once obtained an
engagement as <i>premi√®re danseuse</i>, first at Brussels and then at
Rouen. Under her grandmother&rsquo;s family name of Camargo she
made her Paris <i>d√©but</i> in 1726, and at once became the rage.
Every new fashion bore her name; her manner of doing her hair
was copied by all at court; her shoemaker&mdash;she had a tiny foot&mdash;made
his fortune. She had many titled adorers whom she nearly
ruined by her extravagances, among others Louis de Bourbon,
comte de Clermont. At his wish she retired from the stage from
1736 to 1741. In her time she appeared in seventy-eight ballets
or operas, always to the delight of the public. She was the first
ballet-dancer to shorten the skirt to what afterwards became the

<p><span class="bold">CAMARGUE<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> (<i>Insula Camaria</i>), a thinly-populated region of
southern France contained wholly in the department of
Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne,
and comprising the delta of the Rhone. The
Camargue is a marshy plain of alluvial formation enclosed
between the two branches of the river, the Grand Rh√¥ne to the
east and the Petit Rh√¥ne to the west. Its average elevation is
from 6¬Ω to 8 ft. The Camargue has a coast-line some 30 m. in
length and an area of 290 sq. m., of which about a quarter consists
of cultivated and fertile land. This is in the north and on the
banks of the rivers. The rest consists of rough pasture grazed by
the black bulls and white horses of the region and by large flocks
of sheep, or of marsh, stagnant water and waste land impregnated
with salt. The region is inhabited by flocks of flamingoes,
bustards, partridge, and by sea-birds of various kinds. The
√âtang de Vaccar√®s, the largest of the numerous lagoons and
pools, covers about 23 sq. m.; it receives three main canals constructed
to drain off the minor lagoons. The Camargue is
protected by dikes from the inundations both of the sea and of
the rivers. Inlets in the sea-dike let in water for the purposes of
the lagoon fisheries and the salt-pans; and the river-water is
used for irrigation and for the submersion of vines. The
climate is characterized by hard winters and scorching summers.
Rain falls in torrents, but at considerable intervals. The mistral,
blowing from the north and north-west, is the prevailing wind.
The south-eastern portion of the Camargue is known as the Ile
du Plan du Bourg. A secondary delta to the west of the Petit
Rh√¥ne goes by the name of Petite Camargue.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMARINA,<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> an ancient city of Sicily, situated on the south
coast, about 17 m. S.E. of Gela (Terranova). It was founded by
Syracuse in 599 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, but destroyed by the mother city in 552 for
attempting to assert its independence. Hippocrates of Gela
received its territory from Syracuse and restored the town in 492,
but it was destroyed by Gelon in 484; the Geloans, however,
founded it anew in 461. It seems to have been in general hostile
to Syracuse, but, though an ally of Athens in 427, it gave some
slight help to Syracuse in 415-413. It was destroyed by the
Carthaginians in 405, restored by Timoleon in 339 after its
abandonment by Dionysius&rsquo;s order, but in 258 fell into the
hands of the Romans. Its complete destruction dates from
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 853. The site of the ancient city is among rapidly shifting
sandhills, and the lack of stone in the neighbourhood has led to
its buildings being used as a quarry even by the inhabitants of

<p><span class="bold">CAMBAC√âR√àS, JEAN JACQUES R√âGIS DE,<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> duke of Parma
(1753-1824), French statesman, was born at Montpellier on the
18th of October 1753. He was descended from a well-known
family of the legal nobility (<i>noblesse de la robe</i>). He was designed
for the magistracy of his province; and in 1771, when for a time
the provincial parlement was suppressed, with the others, by the
chancellor Maupeou, he refused to sit in the royal tribunal
substituted for it. He continued, however, to study law with
ardour, and in 1774 succeeded his father as councillor in the
court of accounts and finances of his native town. Espousing
the principles of the Revolution in 1789, he was commissioned
by the <i>noblesse</i> of the province to draw up the <i>cahier</i> (statement of
principles and grievances); and the <i>s√©n√©chauss√©e</i> of Montpellier
elected him deputy to the states-general of Versailles; but the
election was annulled on a technical point. Nevertheless in
1792 the new department of H√©rault, in which Montpellier is
situated, sent him as one of its deputies to the Convention
which assembled and proclaimed the Republic in September
1792. In the strife which soon broke out between the Girondins
and the Jacobins he took no decided part, but occupied himself
mainly with the legal and legislative work which went on almost
without intermission even during the Terror. The action of
Cambac√©r√®s at the time of the trial of Louis XVI. (December
25, 1792-January 20, 1793) was characteristic of his habits of
thought. At first he protested against the erection of the
Convention into a tribunal in these words: &ldquo;The people has
chosen you to be legislators; it has not appointed you as judges.&rdquo;
He also demanded that the king should have due facilities for his
defence. Nevertheless, when the trial proceeded, he voted with
the majority which declared Louis to be guilty, but recommended
that the penalty should be postponed until the cessation of
hostilities, and that the sentence should then be ratified by the
Convention or by some other legislative body. It is therefore
inexact to count him among the regicides, as was done by the
royalists after 1815. Early in 1793 he became a member of the
Committee of General Defence, but he did not take part in the
work of its more famous successor, the Committee of Public
Safety, until the close of the year 1794. In the meantime he had
done much useful work, especially that of laying down, conjointly
with Merlin of Douai, the principles on which the legislation of
the revolutionary epoch should be codified. At the close of 1794
he also used his tact and eloquence on behalf of the restoration of
the surviving Girondins to the Convention, from which they had
been driven by the <i>coup d&rsquo;√©tat</i> of the 31st of May 1793. In the
course of the year 1795, as president of the Committee of Public
Safety, and as responsible especially for foreign affairs, he was
largely instrumental in bringing about peace with Spain. Nevertheless,
not being a regicide, he was not appointed to be one of
the five Directors to whom the control of public affairs was
entrusted after the <i>coup d&rsquo;√©tat</i> of Vend√©miaire 1795; but, as
before, his powers of judgment and of tactful debating soon
carried him to the front in the council of Five Hundred. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>81</span>
moderation of his views brought him into opposition to the
Directors after the <i>coup d&rsquo;√©tat</i> of Fructidor (September 1797),
and for a time he retired into private life. Owing, however, to
the influence of Siey√®s, he became minister of justice in July
1799. He gave a guarded support to Bonaparte and Siey√®s in
their enterprise of overthrowing the Directory (<i>coup d&rsquo;√©tat</i> of
Brumaire 1799).</p>

<p>After a short interval Cambac√©r√®s was, by the constitution of
December 1799, appointed second consul of France&mdash;a position
which he owed largely to his vast legal knowledge and to the
conviction which Siey√®s entertained of his value as a manipulator
of public assemblies. It is impossible here to describe in
detail his relations to Napoleon, and the part which he played in
the drawing up of the Civil Code, later on called the Code
Napoleon. It must suffice to say that the skilful intervention of
Cambac√©r√®s helped very materially to ensure to Napoleon the
consulship for life (August 1, 1802); but the second consul is
known to have disapproved of some of the events which followed,
notably the execution of the duc d&rsquo;Enghien, the rupture with
England, and the proclamation of the Empire (May 19, 1804).
This last occurrence ended his title of second consul; it was
replaced by that of arch-chancellor of the Empire. To him was
decreed the presidence of the Senate in perpetuity. He also
became a prince of the Empire and received in 1808 the title
duke of Parma. Apart from the important part which he took in
helping to co-ordinate and draft the Civil Code, Cambac√©r√®s did
the state good service in many directions, notably by seeking to
curb the impetuosity of the emperor, and to prevent enterprises
so fatal as the intervention in Spanish affairs (1808) and the
invasion of Russia (1812) proved to be. At the close of the
campaign of 1814 he shared with Joseph Bonaparte the responsibility
for some of the actions which zealous Bonapartists have
deemed injurious to the fortunes of the emperor. In 1815,
during the Hundred Days, he took up his duties reluctantly at
the bidding of Napoleon; and after the second downfall of his
master, he felt the brunt of royalist vengeance, being for a time
exiled from France. A decree of 13th May 1818 restored him to
his civil rights as a citizen of France; but the last six years of his
life he spent in retirement. He was a member of the Academy
till the 31st of March 1816, when a decree of exclusion was
passed. In demeanour he was quiet, reserved and tactful, but
when occasion called for it he proved himself a brilliant orator.
He was a celebrated <i>gourmet</i>, and his dinners were utilized by
Napoleon as a useful adjunct to the arts of statecraft.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMBALUC,<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> the name by which, under sundry modifications,
the royal city of the great khan in China became known to Europe
during the middle ages, that city being in fact the same that we
now know as Peking. The word itself represents the Mongol
Khan-Balik, &ldquo;the city of the khan,&rdquo; or emperor, the title by
which Peking continues, more or less, to be known to the Mongols
and other northern Asiatics.</p>

<p>A city occupying approximately the same site had been the
capital of one of the principalities into which China was divided
some centuries before the Christian era; and during the reigns
of the two Tatar dynasties that immediately preceded the Mongols
in northern China, viz. that of the Khitans, and of the Kin or
&ldquo;Golden&rdquo; khans, it had been one of their royal residences.
Under the names of Yenking, which it received from the Khitan,
and of Chung-tu, which it had from the Kin, it holds a conspicuous
place in the wars of Jenghiz Khan against the latter dynasty.
He captured it in 1215, but it was not till 1284 that it was adopted
as the imperial residence in lieu of Karakorum in the Mongol
steppes by his grandson Kublai. The latter selected a position
a few hundred yards to the north-east of the old city of Chung-tu
or Yenking, where he founded the new city of Ta-tu (&ldquo;great
capital&rdquo;), called by the Mongols Taidu or Daitu, but also Khan-Balik;
and from this time dates the use of the latter name as
applied to this site.</p>

<p>The new city formed a rectangle, enclosed by a colossal mud
rampart, the longer sides of which ran north and south. These
were each about 5<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> English m. in length, the shorter sides 3¬æ m.,
so that the circuit was upwards of 18 m. The palace of the
khan, with its gardens and lake, itself formed an inner enclosure
fronting the south. There were eleven city gates, viz. three on
the south side, always the formal front with the Tatars, and two
on each of the other sides; and the streets ran wide and straight
from gate to gate (except, of course, where interrupted by the
palace walls), forming an oblong chess-board plan.</p>

<p>Ta-tu continued to be the residence of the emperors till the
fall of the Mongol power (1368). The native dynasty (Ming)
which supplanted them established their residence at Nan-king
(&ldquo;South Court&rdquo;), but this proved so inconvenient that Yunglo,
the third sovereign of the dynasty, reoccupied Ta-tu, giving it
then, for the first time, the name of Pe-king (&ldquo;North Court&rdquo;).
This was the name in common use when the Jesuits entered
China towards the end of the 16th century, and began to send
home accurate information about China. But it is not so now;
the names in ordinary use being King-cheng or King-tu, both
signifying &ldquo;capital.&rdquo; The restoration of Cambaluc was commenced
in 1409. The size of the city was diminished by the
retrenchment of nearly one-third at the northern end, which
brought the enceinte more nearly to a square form. And this
constitutes the modern (so-called) &ldquo;Tatar city&rdquo; of Peking, the
south front of which is identical with the south front of the city
of Kublai. The walls were completed in 1437. Population
gathered about the southern front, probably using the material of
the old city of Yenking, and the excrescence so formed was, in
1544, enclosed by a wall and called the &ldquo;outer city.&rdquo; It is the
same that is usually called by Europeans &ldquo;the Chinese city.&rdquo;
The ruins of the retrenched northern portion of Kublai&rsquo;s great
rampart are still prominent along their whole extent, so that
there is no room for question as to the position or true dimensions
of the Cambaluc of the middle ages; and it is most probable,
indeed it is almost a necessity, that the present palace stands on
the lines of Kublai&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>The city, under the name of Cambaluc, was constituted into an
archiepiscopal see by Pope Clement V. in 1307, in favour of the
missionary Franciscan John of Montecorvino (d. 1330); but
though some successors were nominated it seems probable that
no second metropolitan ever actually occupied the seat.</p>

<p>Maps of the 16th and 17th centuries often show Cambaluc in
an imaginary region to the north of China, a part of the misconception
that has prevailed regarding Cathay. The name is
often in popular literature written Cambalu, and is by Longfellow
accented in verse <i>C√°mb&#259;l√∫</i>. But this spelling originates in an
accidental error in Ramusio&rsquo;s Italian version, which was the chief
channel through which Marco Polo&rsquo;s book was popularly known.
The original (French) MSS. all agree with the etymology in calling
it Cambaluc, which should be accented <i>C&#259;mb√°luc</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMBAY,<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> a native state of India, within the Gujarat division
of Bombay. It has an area of 350 sq. m. Pop. (1901) 75,225,
showing a decrease of 16% in the decade, due to the famine of
1899-1900. The estimated gross revenue is ¬£27,189; the tribute,
¬£1460. In physical character Cambay is entirely an alluvial
plain. As a separate state it dates only from about 1730, the
time of the dismemberment of the Mogul empire. The present
chiefs are descended from Momin Khan II., the last of the
governors of Gujarat, who in 1742 murdered his brother-in-law,
Nizam Khan, governor of Cambay, and established himself there.</p>

<p>The town of <span class="sc">Cambay</span> had a population in 1901 of 31,780. It
is supposed to be the <i>Camanes</i> of Ptolemy, and was formerly a
very flourishing city, the seat of an extensive trade, and celebrated
for its manufactures of silk, chintz and gold stuffs; but
owing principally to the gradually increasing difficulty of access
by water, owing to the silting up of the gulf, its commerce has
long since fallen away, and the town has become poor and
dilapidated. The spring tides rise upwards of 30 ft., and in a
channel usually so shallow form a serious danger to shipping. The
trade is chiefly confined to the export of cotton. The town is
celebrated for its manufacture of agate and carnelian ornaments,
of reputation principally in China. The houses in many instances
are built of stone (a circumstance which indicates the former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
wealth of the city, as the material had to be brought from a very
considerable distance); and remains of a brick wall, 3 m. in
circumference, which formerly surrounded the town, enclose four
large reservoirs of good water and three bazaars. To the south-east
there are very extensive ruins of subterranean temples and
other buildings half-buried in the sand by which the ancient
town was overwhelmed. These temples belong to the Jains, and
contain two massive statues of their deities, the one black, the
other white. The principal one, as the inscription intimates,
is Pariswanath, or Parswanath, carved in the reign of the
emperor Akbar; the black one has the date of 1651 inscribed.
In 1780 Cambay was taken by the army of General Goddard, was
restored to the Mahrattas in 1783, and was afterwards ceded to the
British by the peshwa under the treaty of 1803. It was provided
with a railway in 1901 by the opening of the 11 m. required
to connect with the gaekwar of Baroda&rsquo;s line through Petlad.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMBAY, GULF OF,<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> an inlet in the coast of India, in the
Gujarat division of Bombay. It is about 80 m. in length, but
is shallow and abounds in shoals and sandbanks. It is supposed
that the depth of water in this gulf has been decreasing for more
than two centuries past. The tides, which are very high, run
into it with amazing velocity, but at low water the bottom is
left nearly dry for some distance below the latitude of the town
of Cambay. It is, however, an important inlet, being the channel
by which the valuable produce of central Gujarat and the
British districts of Ahmedabad and Broach is exported; but the
railway from Bombay to Baroda and Ahmedabad, near Cambay,
has for some time past been attracting the trade to itself.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMBERT, ROBERT<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> (1628-1677), French operatic composer,
was born in Paris in 1628. He was a pupil of Chambonni√®res.
In 1655, after he had obtained the post of organist at the church
of St Honor√©, he married Marie du Moustier. He was musical
superintendent to Queen Anne of Austria, mother of Louis XIV.,
and for a time held a post with the marquis de Sourdeac. His
earlier works, the words of which were furnished by Pierre
Perrin, continued to be performed before the court at Vincennes
till the death of his patron Cardinal Mazarin. In 1669 Perrin
received a patent for the founding of the <i>Acad√©mie Nationale de
musique</i>, the germ of the Grand Op√©ra, and Cambert had a share
in the administration until both he and Perrin were discarded
in the interests of Lulli. Displeased at his subsequent neglect,
and jealous of the favour shown to Lulli, who was musical
superintendent to the king, he went in 1673 to London, where
soon after his arrival he was appointed master of the band to
Charles II. One at least of his operas, <i>Pomone</i>, was performed in
London under his direction, but it did not suit the popular taste,
and he is supposed to have killed himself in London in 1677.
His other principal operas were <i>Ariadne ou les amours de Bacchus</i>
and <i>Les Peines et les plaisirs de l&lsquo;amour</i>.</p>

England, bounded N. by Southwark and Bermondsey, E. by
Deptford and Lewisham, W. by Lambeth, and extending S. to
the boundary of the county of London. Pop, (1901) 259,339.
Area, 4480 acres. It appears in Domesday, but the derivation
of the name is unknown. It includes the districts of Peckham
and Nunhead, and Dulwich (<i>q.v.</i>) with its park, picture-gallery
and schools. Camberwell is mainly residential, and there are
many good houses, pleasantly situated in Dulwich and southward
towards the high ground of Sydenham. Dulwich Park
(72 acres) and Peckham Rye Common and Park (113 acres) are
the largest of several public grounds, and Camberwell Green
was once celebrated for its fairs. Immediately outside the
southern boundary lies a well-known place of recreation,
the Crystal Palace. Among institutions may be mentioned the
Camberwell school of arts and crafts, Peckham Road. In
Camberwell Road is Cambridge House, a university settlement,
founded in 1897 and incorporating the earlier Trinity settlement.
The parliamentary borough of Camberwell has three divisions,
North, Peckham and Dulwich, each returning one member:
but is not wholly coincident with the municipal borough, the
Dulwich division extending to include Penge, outside the
county of London. The borough council consists of a mayor,
ten aldermen, and sixty councillors.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMBIASI, LUCA<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> (1527-1585), Genoese painter, familiarly
known as Lucchetto da Genova (his surname is written also
Cambiaso or Cangiagio), was born at Moneglia in the Genoese
state, the son of a painter named Giovanni Cambiasi. He took to
drawing at a very early age, imitating his father, and developed
great aptitude for foreshortening. At the age of fifteen he painted,
along with his father, some subjects from Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Metamorphoses</i>
on the front of a house in Genoa, and afterwards, in conjunction
with Marcantonio Calvi, a ceiling showing great daring of
execution in the Palazzo Doria. He also formed an early friendship
with Giambattista Castello; both artists painted together,
with so much similarity of style that their works could hardly
be told apart; from this friend Cambiasi learned much in the
way of perspective and architecture. Luchetto&rsquo;s best artistic
period lasted for twelve years after his first successes; from that
time he declined in power, though not at once in reputation,
owing to the agitations and vexations brought upon him by a
passion which he conceived for his sister-in-law. His wife having
died, and the sister-in-law having taken charge of his house and
children, he endeavoured to procure a papal dispensation for
marrying her; but in this he was disappointed. In 1583 he
accepted an invitation from Philip II. to continue in the Escorial
a series of frescoes which had been begun by Castello, now
deceased; and it is said that one principal reason for his closing
with this offer was that he hoped to bring the royal influence to
bear upon the pope, but in this again he failed. Worn out with
his disquietudes, he died in the Escorial in the second year of his
sojourn. Cambiasi had an ardent fancy, and was a bold designer
in a Raphaelesque mode. His extreme facility astonished the
Spanish painters; and it is said that Philip II., watching one day
with pleasure the offhand zest with which Luchetto was painting
a head of a laughing child, was allowed the further surprise of
seeing the laugh changed, by a touch or two upon the lips, into a
weeping expression. The artist painted sometimes with a brush
in each hand, and with a certainty equalling or transcending that
even of Tintoret. He made a vast number of drawings, and was
also something of a sculptor, executing in this branch of art a
figure of Faith. Altogether he ranks as one of the ablest artists
of his day. In personal character, notwithstanding his executive
energy, he is reported to have been timid and diffident. His son
Orazio became likewise a painter, studying under Luchetto.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The best works of Cambiasi are to be seen in Genoa. In the
church of S. Giorgio&mdash;the martyrdom of that saint; in the Palazzo
Imperiali Terralba, a Genoese suburb&mdash;a fresco of the &ldquo;Rape of the
Sabines&rdquo;; in S. Maria da Carignano&mdash;a &ldquo;Piet√†,&rdquo; containing his own
portrait and (according to tradition) that of his beloved sister-in-law.
In the Escorial he executed several pictures; one is a Paradise
on the vaulting of the church, with a multitude of figures. For this
picture he received 12,000 ducats, probably the largest sum that had,
up to that time, ever been given for a single work.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMBODIA<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span><a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (called by the inhabitants <i>Sroc Khmer</i> and by the
French <i>Cambodge</i>), a country of south-eastern Asia and a protectorate
of France, forming part of French Indo-China.</p>

<p><i>Geography</i>.&mdash;It is bounded N. by Siam and Laos, E. by
Annam, S.E. and S. by Cochin-China, S.W. by the Gulf of Siam,
and W. by Siam. Its area is estimated at approximately
65,000 sq. m.; its population at 1,500,000, of whom some
three-quarters are Cambodians, the rest Chinese, Annamese,
Chams, Malays, and aboriginal natives. The whole of Cambodia
lies in the basin of the lower Mekong, which, entering this
territory on the north, flows south for some distance, then inclines
south-west as far as Pnom-penh, where it spreads into a delta and
resumes a southerly course. The salient feature of Cambodian
geography is the large lake Tonl√©-Sap, in a depression 68 m. long
from south-east to north-west and 15 m. wide. It is fed by several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
rivers and innumerable torrents, and at flood-time serves as a
reservoir for the Mekong, with which it is connected by a channel
some 70 m. long, known as the Bras du Lac and joining the river at
Pnom-Penh. In June the waters of the Mekong, swollen by the rains
and the melting of the Tibetan snows, rise to a height of 40 to 45
ft. and flow through the Bras du Lac towards the lake, which then
covers an area of 770 sq. m., and like the river inundates the
marshes and forests on its borders. During the dry season the
current reverses and the depression empties so that the lake
shrinks to an area of 100 sq. m., and its depth falls from 45-48 ft.
to a maximum of 5 ft. Tonl√©-Sap probably represents the chief
wealth of Cambodia. It supports a fishing population of over
30,000, most of whom are Annamese; the fish, which are taken by
means of large nets at the end of the inundation, are either dried
or fermented for the production of the sauce known as <i>nuoc-mam</i>.
The northern and western provinces of Cambodia which fall
outside the densely populated zone of inundation are thinly
peopled; they consist of plateaus, in many places thickly
wooded and intersected by mountains, the highest of which does
not exceed 5000 ft. The region to the east of the Mekong is
traversed by spurs of the mountains of Annam and by affluents
of the Mekong, the most important of these being the Se-khong
and the Tonle-srepok, which unite to flow into the Mekong at
Stung-treng. Small islands, inhabited by a fishing population,
fringe the west coast.</p>

<p><i>Climate, Fauna and Flora.</i>&mdash;The climate of Cambodia, like
that of Cochin China, which it closely resembles, varies with the
monsoons. During the north-east monsoon, from the middle of
October to the middle of April, dry weather prevails and the
thermometer averages from 77¬∞ to 80¬∞ F. During the south-west
monsoon, from the middle of April to the middle of
October, rain falls daily and the temperature varies between
85¬∞ and 95¬∞. The wild animals of Cambodia include the
elephant, which is also domesticated, the rhinoceros, buffalo and
some species of wild ox; also the tiger, panther, leopard and
honey-bear. Wild boars, monkeys and rats abound and are the
chief enemies of the cultivator. The crocodile is found in the
Mekong, and there are many varieties of reptiles, some of them
venomous. The horse of Cambodia is only from 11 to 12 hands in
height, but is strong and capable of great endurance; the buffalo
is the chief draught animal. Swine are reared in large numbers.
Nux vomica, gamboge, caoutchouc, cardamoms, teak and other
valuable woods and gums are among the natural products.</p>

<p><i>People</i>.&mdash;The Cambodians have a far more marked affinity
with their Siamese than with their Annamese neighbours. The
race is probably the result of a fusion of the Malay aborigines of
Indo-China with the Aryan and Mongolian invaders of the
country. The men are taller and more muscular than the
Siamese and Annamese, while the women are small and inclined
to stoutness. The face is flat and wide, the nose short, the mouth
large and the eyes only slightly oblique. The skin is dark brown,
the hair black and, while in childhood the head is shaved with
the exception of a small tuft at the top, in later life it is dressed
so as to resemble a brush. Both sexes wear the langouti or loin-cloth,
which the men supplement with a short jacket, the women
with a long scarf draped round the figure or with a long clinging
robe. Morose, superstitious, and given to drinking and gambling,
the Cambodians are at the same time clean, fairly intelligent,
proud and courageous. The wife enjoys a respected position and
divorce may be demanded by either party. Polygamy is almost
confined to the richer classes. Though disinclined to work, the
Cambodians make good hunters and woodsmen. Many of them
live on the borders of the Mekong and the great lake, in huts
built upon piles or floating rafts. The religion of Cambodia is
Buddhism, and involves great respect towards the dead; the
worship of spirits or local genii is also wide-spread, and Brahmanism
is still maintained at the court. Monks or <i>bonzes</i> are very
numerous; they live by alms and in return they teach the
young to read, and superintend coronations, marriages, funerals
and the other ceremonials which play a large part in the lives of
the Cambodians. As in the rest of Indo-China, there is no
hereditary nobility, but there exist castes founded on blood-relationship&mdash;the
members of the royal family within the fifth
degree (the <i>Brah-Vansa</i>) those beyond the fifth degree (<i>Brah-Van</i>),
and the <i>Bakou</i>, who, as descendants of the ancient Brahmans,
exercise certain official functions at the court. These
castes, as well as the mandarins, who form a class by themselves,
are exempt from tax or forced service. The mandarins are
nominated by the king and their children have a position at court,
and are generally chosen to fill the vacant posts in the administration.
Under the native r√©gime the common people attached
themselves to one or other of the mandarins, who in return
granted them the protection of his influence. Under French rule,
which has modified the old usages in many respects, local government
of the Annamese type tends to supplant this feudal system.
Slavery was abolished by a royal ordinance of 1897.</p>

<p>Cambodian idiom bears a likeness to some of the aboriginal
dialects of south Indo-China; it is agglutinate in character and
rich in vowel-sounds. The king&rsquo;s language and the royal writing,
and also religious words are, however, apparently of Aryan
origin and akin to Pali. Cambodian writing is syllabic and complicated.
The books (manuscripts) are generally formed of palm-leaves
upon which the characters are traced by means of a style.</p>

<p><i>Industry and Commerce.</i>&mdash;Iron, worked by the tribe of the
Kouis, is found in the mountainous region. The Cambodians
show skill in working gold and silver; earthenware, bricks, mats,
fans and silk and cotton fabrics, are also produced to some
small extent, but fishing and the cultivation of rice and in a minor
degree of tobacco, coffee, cotton, pepper, indigo, maize, tea and
sugar are the only industries worthy of the name. Factories
exist near Pnom-Penh for the shelling of cotton-seeds. The
Cambodian is his own artificer and self-sufficing so far as his own
needs are concerned. Rice, dried fish, beans, pepper and oxen
are the chief elements in the export trade of the country, which
is in the hands of Chinese. The native plays little or no part in
commerce.</p>

<p>Trade is carried on chiefly through Saigon in Cochin-China,
Kampot, the only port of Cambodia, being accessible solely to
coasting vessels. With the exception of the highway from
Pnom-Penh (<i>q.v.</i>) the capital, to Kampot, the roads of Cambodia
are not suited for vehicles. Pnom-Penh communicates regularly
by the steamers of the &ldquo;Messageries Fluviales&rdquo; by way of the
Mekong with Saigon.</p>

<p><i>Administration</i>.&mdash;At the head of the government is the king
(<i>r&#257;j</i>). His successor is either nominated by himself, in which
case he sometimes abdicates in his favour, or else elected by the
five chief mandarins from among the Brah Vansa. The <i>upayuvr&#257;j</i>
(<i>obbaioureach</i>) or king who has abdicated, the heir-presumptive
(<i>upar&#257;j, obbareach</i>) and the first princess of the blood
are high dignitaries with their own retinues. The king is
advised by a council of five ministers, the superior members of the
class of mandarins; and the kingdom is divided into about
fifty provinces administered by members of that body. France
is represented by a resident superior, who presides over the
ministerial council and is the real ruler of the country, and by
residents exercising supervision in the districts into which the
country is split up for the purposes of the French administration.
In each residential district there is a council, composed of natives
and presided over by the resident, which deliberates on questions
affecting the district. The resident superior is assisted by the
protectorate council, consisting of heads of French administrative
departments (chief of the judicial service, of public works. &amp;c.)
and one native &ldquo;notable,&rdquo; and the royal orders must receive its
sanction before they can be executed. The control of foreign
policy, public works, the customs and the exchequer are in
French hands, while the management of police, the collection of
the direct taxes and the administration of justice between
natives remain with the native government. A French tribunal
alone is competent to settle disputes where one of the parties is
not a native.</p>

<p>The chief sources of revenue are the direct taxes, including
the poll-tax and the taxes on the products of the soil, which
together amounted to ¬£172,636 in 1904. The chief heads of
expenditure are the civil list, comprising the personal allowance
to the king and the royal family (¬£46,018 in 1904),
public works (¬£39,593) and government house and residences
(¬£29,977).</p>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The Khmers, the ancient inhabitants of Cambodia,
are conjectured to have been the offspring of a fusion between
the autochthonous dwellers in the Indo-Chinese peninsula, now
represented by the Kouis and other savage tribes, and an invading
race from the plateaus of central Asia. As early as the 12th
century <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, Chinese chronicles, which are almost the only source
for the history of Cambodia till the 5th century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>, mention a
region called Fou-nan, in later times appearing under the name of
Tchin-la; embracing the basin of the Menam, it extended eastwards
to the Mekong and may be considered approximately
coextensive with the Khmer kingdom. Some centuries before
the Christian era, immigrants from the east coast of India began to
exert a powerful influence over Cambodia, into which they
introduced Brahmanism and the Sanskrit language. This Hinduizing
process became more marked about the 5th century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>,
when, under S&rsquo;rutavarman, the Khmers as a nation rose into
prominence. The name <i>Kambuja</i>, whence the European form
Cambodia, is derived from the Hindu <i>Kambu</i>, the name of the
mythical founder of the Khmer race; it seems to have been
officially adopted by the Khmers as the title of their country
about this period. At the end of the 7th century the dynasty of
S&rsquo;rutavarman ceased to rule over the whole of Cambodia, which
during the next century was divided into two portions ruled over
by two sovereigns. Unity appears to have been re-established
about the beginning of the 9th century, when with Jayavarman
III. there begins a dynasty which embraces the zenith of Khmer
greatness and the era during which the great Brahman monuments
were built. The royal city of Angkor-Thorn (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Angkor</a></span>)
was completed under Yasovarman about <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 900. In the
10th century Buddhism, which had existed for centuries in
Cambodia, began to become powerful and to rival Brahmanism,
the official religion. The construction of the temple of Angkor
Vat dates probably from the first half of the 12th century, and
appears to have been carried out under the direction of the
Brahman Divakara, who enjoyed great influence under the
monarchs of this period. The conquest of the rival kingdom of
Champa, which embraced modern Cochin-China and southern
Annam, and in the later 15th century was absorbed by Annam,
may probably be placed at the end of the 12th century, in the
reign of Jayavarman VIII., the last of the great kings. War was
also carried on against the western neighbours of Cambodia, and
the exhaustion consequent upon all these efforts seems to have
been the immediate cause of the decadence which now set in.
From the last decade of the 13th century there dates a valuable
description of Tchin-la<a name="fa2f" id="fa2f" href="#ft2f"><span class="sp">2</span></a> written by a member of a Chinese
embassy thereto. The same period probably also witnessed the
liberation of the Thais or inhabitants of Siam from the yoke of
the Khmers, to whom they had for long been subject, and the
expulsion of the now declining race from the basin of the Menam.
The royal chronicles of Cambodia, the historical veracity of
which has often to be questioned, begin about the middle of the
14th century, at which period the Thais assumed the offensive
and were able repeatedly to capture and pillage Angkor-Thorn.
These aggressions were continued in the 15th century, in the
course of which the capital was finally abandoned by the Khmer
kings, the ruin of the country being hastened by internal revolts
and by feuds between members of the royal family. At the end of
the 16th century, Lovek, which had succeeded Angkor-Thorn as
capital, was itself abandoned to the conquerors. During that
century, the Portuguese had established some influence in the
country, whither they were followed by the Dutch, but after the
middle of the 17th century, Europeans counted for little in
Cambodia till the arrival of the French. At the beginning of the
17th century the Nguyen, rulers of southern Annam, began to
encroach on the territory of Cochin-China, and in the course of
that and the 18th century, Cambodia, governed by two kings
supported respectively by Siam and Annam, became a field for
the conflicts of its two powerful neighbours. At the end of the
18th century the provinces of Battambang and Siem-reap were
annexed by Siam. The rivalries of the two powers were concluded
after a last and indecisive war by the treaty of 1846, as a
result of which Ang-Duong, the prot√©g√© of Siam, was placed on
the throne at the capital of Oudong, and the Annamese evacuated
the country. In 1863, in order to counteract Siamese influence
there, Doudart de Lagr√©e was sent by Admiral la Grandi√®re to the
court of King Norodom, the successor of Ang-Duong, and as a
result of his efforts Cambodia placed itself under the protectorate
of France. In 1866 Norodom transferred his capital to Pnom-Penh.
In 1867 a treaty between France and Siam was signed,
whereby Siam renounced its right to tribute and recognized the
French protectorate over Cambodia in return for the provinces of
Battambang and Angkor, and the Laos territory as far as the
Mekong. In 1884 another treaty was signed by the king, confirming
and extending French influence, and reducing the royal
authority to a shadow, but in view of the discontent aroused by
it, its provisions were not put in force till several years later.
In 1904 the territory of Cambodia was increased by the addition
to it of the Siamese provinces of Melupr√© and Bassac, and
the maritime district of Krat, the latter of which, together
with the province of Dansai, was in 1907 exchanged for the
provinces of Battambang, Siem-reap and Sisophon. By the
same treaty France renounced its sphere of influence on the
right bank of the Mekong. In 1904 King Norodom was succeeded
by his brother Sisowath.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMBON, PIERRE JOSEPH<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> (1756-1820), French statesman,
was the son of a wealthy cotton merchant at Montpellier. In
1785 his father retired, leaving the direction of the business to
Pierre and his two brothers, but in 1788 Pierre turned aside to
politics, and was sent by his fellow-citizens as deputy <i>suppl√©ant</i>
to Versailles, where he was little more than a spectator. In
January 1790 he returned to Montpellier, was elected a member
of the municipality, was one of the founders of the Jacobin club
in that city, and on the flight of Louis XVI. in 1791, he drew up
a petition to invite the Constituent Assembly to proclaim a
republic,&mdash;the first in date of such petitions. Elected to the
Legislative Assembly, Cambon became noted for his independence,
his honesty and his ability in finance. He was the most active
member of the committee of finance and was often charged to
verify the state of the treasury. Nothing could be more false
than the common opinion that as a financier his sole expedient
was to multiply the emissions of <i>assignats</i>. His remarkable
speech of the 24th of November 1791 is a convincing proof of his
sagacity. In politics, while he held aloof from the clubs, and
even from parties, he was an ardent defender of the new institutions.
On the 9th of February 1792, he succeeded in having a
law passed sequestrating the possessions of the <i>emigr√©s</i>, and demanded,
though in vain, the deportation of refractory priests to
French Guiana. He was the last president of the Legislative
Assembly. Re-elected to the Convention, he opposed the pretensions
of the Commune and the proposed grant of money to
the municipality of Paris by the state. He denounced Marat&rsquo;s
placards as inciting to murder, summoned Danton to give an
account of his ministry, watched carefully over the furnishing
of military supplies, and was a strong opponent of Dumouriez,
in spite of the general&rsquo;s great popularity. Cambon then incurred
the hatred of Robespierre by proposing the suppression of the
pay to the clergy, which would have meant the separation of
church and state. His authority grew steadily. On the 15th of
December 1792 he got the Convention to adopt a proclamation to
all nations in favour of a universal republic. In the trial of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span>
Louis XVI. he voted for his death, without appeal or postponement.
He attempted to prevent the creation of the Revolutionary
Tribunal, but when called to the first Committee of Public
Safety he worked on it energetically to organize the armies. On
the 3rd of February 1793 he had decreed the emission of 800
millions of <i>assignats</i>, for the expenses of the war. His courageous
intervention in favour of the Girondists on the and of June 1793
served Robespierre as a pretext to prevent his re-election to the
Committee of Public Safety. But Cambon soon came to the
conclusion that the security of France depended upon the triumph
of the Mountain, and he did not hesitate to accord his active co-operation
to the second committee. He took an active share
in the various expedients of the government for stopping the
depreciation of the <i>assignats</i>. He was responsible, especially,
for the great operation known as the opening of the <i>Grand Livre</i>
(August 24), which was designed to consolidate the public debt
by cancelling the stock issued under various conditions prior to
the Revolution, and issuing new stock of a uniform character, so
that all fund-holders should hold stock of the revolutionary government
and thus be interested in its stability. Each fund-holder
was to be entered in the Great Book, or register of the public
debt, for the amount due to him every year. The result of this
measure was a rise in the face value of the <i>assignats</i> from 27%
to 48% by the end of the year. In matters of finance Cambon
was now supreme; but his independence, his hatred of dictatorship,
his protests against the excesses of the Revolutionary
Tribunal, won him Robespierre&rsquo;s renewed suspicion, and on
the 8th Thermidor Robespierre accused him of being anti-revolutionary
and an aristocrat. Cambon&rsquo;s proud and vehement
reply was the signal of the resistance to Robespierre&rsquo;s tyranny
and the prelude to his fall. Cambon soon had reason to repent
of that event, for he became one of those most violently attacked
by the Thermidorian reaction. The royalist pamphlets and the
journals of J.L. Tallien attacked him with fury as a former
<i>Montagnard</i>. He was charged with being responsible for the discredit
of the <i>assignats</i>, and even accused of malversations. On
the 21st of February 1795 the project which he presented to withdraw
four milliards of <i>assignats</i> from circulation, was rejected,
and on the 3rd of April he was excluded from the committee of
finance. On the 16th Germinal, Tallien procured a decree of accusation
against him, but he was already in safety, taking refuge
probably at Lausanne. In any case he does not seem to have remained
in Paris, although in the riot of the 1st Prairial some of the
insurgents proclaimed him mayor. The amnesty of the 4th Brumaire
of the year IV. (the 5th of October 1795), permitted him to
return to France, and he withdrew to his estate of Terral near
Montpellier, where, during the White Terror, he had a narrow
escape from an attempt upon his life. At first Cambon hoped to
find in Bonaparte the saviour of the republic, but, deceived by
the 18th Brumaire, he lived throughout the whole of the empire
in peaceful seclusion. During the Hundred Days he was deputy
for H√©rault in the chamber of representatives, and pronounced
himself strongly against the return of the Bourbons, and for
religious freedom. Under the Restoration the &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo;
law of 1816 condemned him as a regicide to exile, and he withdrew
to Belgium, to St Jean-Ten-Noode, near Brussels, where he died
on the 15th of February 1820.</p>

was born on the 20th of January 1843. He was called to the
Parisian bar, and became private secretary to Jules Ferry in the
prefecture of the Seine. After ten years of administrative work
in France as secretary of prefecture, and then as prefect successively
of the departments of Aube (1872), Doubs (1876), Nord
(1877-1882), he exchanged into the diplomatic service, being
nominated French minister plenipotentiary at Tunis. In 1886

<p><span class="bold">CAMBORNE,<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> a market town in the Camborne parliamentary
division of Cornwall, England, on the Great Western railway,
13 m. E.N.E. of Penzance. Pop. of urban district (1901), 14,726.
It lies on the northward slope of the central elevation of the
county, and is in the neighbourhood of some of the most productive
tin and copper mines. These and the manufacture of
mining machinery employ most of the inhabitants. The parish
church of St Martin contains several monuments and an ancient
stone altar bearing a Latin inscription. There are science and art
and mining schools, and practical mining is taught in South
Condurrow mine, the school attracting a large number of students.
It was developed from classes initiated in 1859 by the Miners&rsquo;
Association, and a three years&rsquo; course of instruction is provided.</p>

<p>Camborne (<i>Cambron, Camron</i>) formed a portion of the extensive
manor of Tehidy, which at the time of the Domesday
Survey was held by the earl of Mortain and subsequently by the
Dunstanville and Basset families. Its interests were economically
insignificant until the beginning of the 18th century when the
rich deposits of copper and tin began to be vigorously worked at
Dolcoath. It has been estimated that in 1788 this mine alone
had produced ore worth ¬£2,000,000 and in 1882 ore worth
¬£5,500,000. As the result of the prosperity of this and other
mines in the neighbourhood the population in 1860 was double
that of 1830, six times that of 1770 and fifteen times that of
1660. Camborne was the scene of the scientific labours of
Richard Trevithick (1771-1833), the engineer, born in the
neighbouring parish of Illogan, and of William Bickford, the
inventor of the safety-fuse, a native of Camborne. Three fairs on
the feasts of St Martin and St Peter and on 25th of February were
granted in 1708. The two former are still held, the last has been
transferred to the 7th of March. A Tuesday market formed the
subject of a judicial inquiry in 1768, but since the middle of the
19th century it has been held on Saturdays.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMBRAI,<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> a town of northern France, capital of an arrondissement
in the department of Nord, 37 m. S.S.E. of Lille on the
main line of the Northern railway. Pop. (1906) 21,791. Cambrai
is situated on the right and eastern bank of the Scheldt (arms of
which traverse the west of the town) and at one extremity of the
canal of St Quentin. The fortifications with which it was formerly
surrounded have been for the most part demolished. The fosses
have been filled up and the ramparts in part levelled to make
way, as the suburbs extended, for avenues stretching out on all
sides. The chief survivals from the demolition are the huge
square citadel, which rises to the east of the town, the chateau de
Selles, a good specimen of the military architecture of the
13th century, and, among other gates, the Porte Notre-Dame, a
stone and brick structure of the early 17th century. Handsome
boulevards now skirt the town, the streets of which are clean and
well-ordered, and a large public garden extends at the foot of the
citadel, with a statue of Enguerrand de Monstrelet the chronicler.
The former cathedral of Cambrai was destroyed after the Revolution.
The present cathedral of Notre-Dame is a church of the
19th century built on the site of the old abbey church of St
S√©pulchre. Among other monuments it contains that of F√©nelon,
archbishop from 1695 to 1715, by David d&rsquo;Angers. The church of
St G√©ry (18th century) contains, among other works of art, a
marble rood-screen of Renaissance workmanship. The Place
d&rsquo;Armes, a large square in the centre of the town, is bordered on
the north by a handsome h√¥tel de ville built in 1634 and rebuilt
in the 19th century. The Tour St Martin is an old church-tower
of the 15th and 18th centuries transformed into a belfry. The
triple stone portal, which gave entrance to the former archiepiscopal
palace, is a work of the Renaissance period. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
present archbishop&rsquo;s palace, adjoining the cathedral, occupies
the site of an old Benedictine convent.</p>

<p>Cambrai is the seat of an archbishop and a sub-prefect, and has
tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a board of trade-arbitrators,
a chamber of commerce and a branch of the Bank
of France. Its educational institutions include communal
colleges, ecclesiastical seminaries, and schools of drawing and
music. The library has over 40,000 volumes and there is a
museum of antiquities and objects of art. The chief industry of
Cambrai is the weaving of muslin (<i>batiste</i>) and other fine
fabrics (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cambric</a></span>); wool-spinning and weaving, bleaching
and dyeing, are carried on, as well as the manufacture of chicory,
oil, soap, sausages and metal boxes. There are also large beet-sugar
works and breweries and distilleries. Trade is in cattle,
grain, coal, hops, seed, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Cambrai is the ancient Nervian town of <i>Camaracum</i>, which is
mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary. In the 5th century it was
the capital of the Frankish king Raguacharius. Fortified by
Charlemagne, it was captured and pillaged by the Normans in
870, and unsuccessfully besieged by the Hungarians in 953.
During the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries it was the scene of
frequent hostilities between the bishop and his supporters on the
one hand and the citizens on the other; but the latter ultimately
effected their independence. In 1478 Louis XI., who had
obtained possession of the town on the death of Charles the Bold,
duke of Burgundy, handed it over to the emperor, and in the
16th century Charles V. caused it to be fortified with a strong
citadel, for the erection of which the castles of Cavillers, Escaudoeuvres
and many others were demolished. From that date to
the peace of Nijmwegen, 1678, which assigned it to France, it
frequently passed from hand to hand by capture or treaty. In
1793 it was besieged in vain by the Austrians. The League of
Cambrai is the name given to the alliance of Pope Julius II.,
Louis XII., Maximilian I., and Ferdinand the Catholic against
the Venetians in 1508; and the peace of Cambrai, or as it is
also called, the Ladies&rsquo; Peace, was concluded in the town in 1529
by Louise of Savoy, mother of Francis I., and Margaret of
Austria, aunt of Charles V., in the name of these monarchs. The
bishopric of Cambrai dates from the 5th century, and was raised
in 1559 to the rank of an archbishopric, which continued till the
Revolution, and has since been restored. The bishops received
the title of count from the emperor Henry I. (919-936), and in
1510 were raised to the dignity of dukes, their territory including
the town itself and its territory, called Cambr√©sis.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMBRIAN SYSTEM,<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> in geology, the name now universally
employed to designate the earliest group of Palaeozoic rocks
which possesses a connected suite of fossils. The strata of this
system rest upon the Pre-Cambrian, and are succeeded by the
Ordovician system. Until the fourth decade of the 19th century
all stratified rocks older than the Carboniferous had been grouped
by geologists into a huge and indefinite &ldquo;Transition Series.&rdquo; In
1831 Adam Sedgwick and Sir Roderick I. Murchison began the
herculean task of studying and sub-dividing this series of rocks as
it occurs in Wales and the bordering counties of England.
Sedgwick attacked the problem in the Snowdon district, where
the rocks are highly altered and displaced and where fossils are
comparatively difficult to obtain; Murchison, on the other hand,
began to work at the upper end of the series where the stratigraphy
is simple and the fossils are abundant. Murchison
naturally made the most of the fossils collected, and was soon able
to show that the transition series could be recognized by them,
just as younger formations had fossils peculiar to themselves; as
he zealously worked on he followed the fossiliferous rocks further
afield and continually lower in the series. This fossil-bearing
set of strata he first styled the &ldquo;fossiliferous greywacke series,&rdquo;
changing it in 1835 to &ldquo;Silurian system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the same year Sedgwick introduced the name &ldquo;Cambrian
series&rdquo; for the older and lower members. Murchison published his
Silurian system in 1839, wherein he recognized the Cambrian to
include the barren slates and grits of Harlech, Llanberis and the
Long Mynd. So far, the two workers had been in agreement;
but in his presidential address to the Geological Society of London
in 1842 Murchison stated his opinion that the Cambrian contained
no fossils that differed from those of the Lower Silurian. Whereupon
Sedgwick undertook a re-examination of the Welsh rocks
with the assistance of J.W. Salter, the palaeontologist; and in
1852 he included the Llandeilo and Bala beds (Silurian) in the
Upper Cambrian. Two years later Murchison brought out his
<i>Siluria</i>, in which he treated the Cambrian system as a mere
local facies of the Silurian system, and he included in the latter,
under J. Barrande&rsquo;s term &ldquo;Primordial zone,&rdquo; all the lower rocks,
although they had a distinctive fauna.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Europe and America fossils were being collected
from similar rocks which were classed as Silurian, and the use of
&ldquo;Cambrian&rdquo; was almost discarded, because, following Murchison,
it was taken to apply only to a group of rocks without a characteristic
fauna and therefore impossible to recognize. Most of
the Cambrian rocks were coloured as Silurian on the British
official geological maps.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, from 1851 to 1855, Sedgwick, in his writings on
the British palaeozoic deposits, insisted on the independence of
the Cambrian system, and though Murchison had pushed his
Silurian system downward in the series of rocks, Sedgwick
adhered to the original grouping of his Cambrian system, and
even proposed to limit the Silurian to the Ludlow and Wenlock
beds with the May Hill Sandstone at the base. This attitude he
maintained until the year of his death (1873), when there appeared
his introduction to Salter&rsquo;s <i>Catalogue of Cambrian and Silurian
Fossils.</i></p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that one of these great geologists was
necessarily in the wrong; each had right on his side. It was
left for the subsequent labours of Salter and H. Hicks to prove
that the rocks below the undoubted lower Silurian of Murchison
did indeed possess a characteristic fauna, and their work was confirmed
by researches going on in other countries. To-day the
recognition of the earliest fossil-bearing recks, below the Llandeilo
formation of Murchison, as belonging to the Cambrian
system, and the threefold subdivision of the system according to
palaeontological evidence, may be regarded as firmly established.</p>

<p>It should be noted that A. de Lapparent classifies the Cambrian
as the lowest stage in the Silurian, the middle and upper stages
being Ordovician and Gothlandian. E. Renevier proposed to use
<i>Silurique</i> to cover the same period with the Cambrian as the
lowest series, but these differences of treatment are merely
nominal. Jules Marcou and others have used <i>Taconic</i> (Taconian)
as the equivalent of Cambrian, and C. Lapworth proposed to apply
the same term to the lowest sub-division only; he had also used
&ldquo;Annelidian&rdquo; in the same sense. These names are of historical
interest alone.</p>

<p><i>Cambrian Rocks.</i>&mdash;The lithological characters of the Cambrian
rocks possess a remarkable uniformity in all quarters of the
globe. Muds, sands, grits and conglomerates are the predominant
types. In Scotland, North America and Canada important
deposits of limestone occur and subordinate limestones are
found in the Cambrian of central Europe.</p>

<p>In some regions, notably in the Baltic province and in parts of
the United States, the rocks still retain their original horizontality
of deposition, the muds are scarcely indurated and the
sands are still incoherent; but in most parts of the world they
bear abundant evidence of the many movements and stresses to
which they have been exposed through so enormous a period of
time. Thus, we find them more frequently, folded, tilted and
cleaved; the muds have become shales, slates, phyllites or
schists, the grey and red sands and conglomerates have become
quartzites and greywackes, while the limestones are very generally
dolomitized. In the Cambrian limestones, as in their more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
recent analogues, layers and nodules of chert and phosphatized
material are not wanting.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:516px; height:415px" src="images/img87.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Igneous rocks are not extensively developed; in Wales they
form an important feature and occur in considerable thickness;
they are represented by lavas of olivine-diabase and by contemporaneous
tuffs which are traversed by later granite and
quartz felsite. In the Cambrian of Brittany there are acid
lavas and tuffs. Quartz porphyry, diabase and diorite appear
in the Ardennes. In Bohemia, North America and Canada
igneous rocks have been observed.</p>

<p>In China, on the Yang-tse river, a thick deposit has been found
full of boulders of diverse kinds of rock, striated in the manner
that is typical of glacial action. A similar deposit occurs in the
Gaisa beds near the Varanger Fjord in Norway. These formations
lie at the base of the lowest Cambrian strata and may
possibly be included in the pre-Cambrian, though in Norway
they are clearly resting upon a striated floor of crystalline rocks.</p>

<p><i>Cambrian Life.</i>&mdash;In a general survey of the life of this period,
as it is revealed by the fossils, three outstanding facts are apparent:
(1) the great divergence between the Cambrian fauna
and that of the present day; (2) the Cambrian life assemblage
differs in no marked manner from that of the succeeding Ordovician
and Silurian periods; there is a certain family likeness
which unites all of them; (3) the extraordinary complexity and
diversity not only in the assemblage as a whole but within
certain limited groups of organisms. Although in the Cambrian
strata we have the oldest known fossiliferous rocks&mdash;if we leave
out of account the very few and very obscure organic remains
hitherto recorded from the pre-Cambrian&mdash;yet we appear to
enter suddenly into the presence of a world richly peopled with a
suite of organisms already far advanced in differentiation; the
Cambrian fauna seems to be as far removed from what must
have been the first forms of life, as the living forms of this remote
period are distant from the creatures of to-day.</p>

<p>With the exception of the vertebrates, every one of the great
classes of animals is represented in Cambrian rocks. Simple
protozoa appear in the form of Radiolaria; Lithistid sponges
are represented by such forms as <i>Archaeoscyphia</i>, Hexactinellid
sponges by <i>Protospongia</i>; Graptolites (<i>Dictyograptus</i> (<i>Dictyonema</i>))
come on in the higher parts of the system. Medusa-like
casts have been found in the lower Cambrian of Scandinavia
(<i>Medusina</i>) and in the mid-Cambrian of Alabama (<i>Brooksella</i>).
Corals, <i>Archaeocyathus, Spirocyathus</i>, &amp;c., lived in the Cambrian
seas along with starfishes (<i>Palaeasterina</i>), Cystideans, <i>Protocystites,
Trochocystites</i> and possibly Crinoids, <i>Dendrocrinus</i>. Annelids
left their traces in burrows and casts on the sea-floor
(<i>Arenicolites, Cruziana, Scolithus</i>, &amp;c.). Crustacea occupied an
extremely prominent place; there were Phyllocarids such as
<i>Hymenocaris</i>, and Ostracods like <i>Entomidella</i>; but by far the
most important in numbers and development were the Trilobites,
now extinct, but in palaeozoic times so abundant. In the
Cambrian period trilobites had already attained their maximum
size; some species of <i>Paradoxides</i> were nearly 2 ft. long, but in
company with these monsters were tiny forms like <i>Agnostus</i> and
<i>Microdiscus</i>. Many of the Cambrian trilobites appear to have
been blind, and they had not at this period developed that
flexibility in the carapace that some forms acquired later.</p>

<p>Brachiopods were fairly abundant, particularly the non-articulated
forms (<i>Obolus, Lingulella, Acrotreta, Discinopsis,</i>
&amp;c.); amongst the articulate genera are <i>Kutorgina, Orthis,
Khynchonella.</i> It is a striking fact that certain of these non-articulate
&ldquo;lamp-shells&rdquo; are familiar inhabitants of our present
seas. Each of the principal groups of true mollusca was represented:
Pelecypods (<i>Modioloides</i>); Gasteropods (<i>Scenella,
Pleurotomaria, Trochonema</i>); Pteropods (<i>Hyohthellus, Hyolithes,
Salleretta</i>); Cephalopods (<i>Orthoceras, Cystoceras</i>). Of
land plants no traces have yet been discovered. Certain
markings on slates and sandstones, such as the &ldquo;fucoids&rdquo; of
Scandinavia and Scotland, the <i>Phycoides</i> of the Fichtelgebirge,
<i>Eophyton</i> and other seaweed-like impressions, may indeed be
the casts of fucoid plants; but it is by no means sure that
many of them are not mere inorganic imitative markings or the
tracks or casts of worms. <i>Oldhamia</i>, a delicate branching body,
abundant in the Cambrian of the south-east of Ireland, is probably
a calcareous alga, but its precise nature has not been satisfactorily
determined.</p>

<p><i>Cambrian Stratigraphy.</i>&mdash;Wherever the Cambrian strata have
been carefully studied it has now been found possible and convenient
to arrange them into three series, each of which is characterized
by a distinctive genus of trilobite. Thus we have a
Lower Cambrian with <i>Olenellus</i>, a middle series with <i>Paradoxides</i>
and an Upper Cambrian with <i>Olenus</i>. It is true that these
fossils are not invariably present in every occurrence of Cambrian
strata, but this fact notwithstanding, the threefold division holds
with sufficient constancy. An uppermost series lies above the
<i>Olenus</i> fauna in some areas; it is represented by the Tremadoc
beds in Britain or by the <i>Dictyonema</i> beds or <i>Euloma-Niobe</i>
fauna elsewhere. Three regions deserve special attention: (1)
Great Britain, the area in which the Cambrian was first differentiated
from the old &ldquo;Transition Series&rdquo;; (2) North America,
on account of the wide-spread occurrence of the rocks and the
abundance and perfection of the fossils; and (3) Bohemia,
made classic by the great labours of J. Barrande.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Great Britain and Ireland.</i>&mdash;The table on p. 88 contains the names
that have been applied to the subdivisions of the Cambrian strata
in the areas of outcrop in Wales and England; at the same time it
indicates approximately their relative position in the system.</p>

<p>In <i>Scotland</i> the upper and middle series are represented by a
thick mass of limestone and dolomite, the Durness limestone
(1500 ft.). In the lower series are, in descending order, the &ldquo;Serpulite
grits&rdquo; or &ldquo;Salterella beds,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Fucoid beds&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Eriboll quartzite,&rdquo; which is divided into an upper &ldquo;Pipe rock&rdquo;
and lower &ldquo;Basal quartzite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Cambrian rocks of <i>Ireland</i>, a great series of purple and green
shales, slates and grits with beds of quartzite, have not yet yielded
sufficient fossil evidence to permit of a correlation with the Welsh
rocks, and possibly some parts of the series may be transferred in
the future to the overlying Ordovician.</p>

<p><i>North America.</i>&mdash;On the North American continent, as in Europe,
the Cambrian system is divisible into three series: (1) the lower
or &ldquo;Georgian,&rdquo; with <i>Olenellus</i> fauna; (2) the middle or &ldquo;Acadian,&rdquo;
with <i>Paradoxides or Dikelocephalus</i> fauna; (3) the upper or &ldquo;Potsdam,&rdquo;
with <i>Olenus</i> fauna (with Saratogan or St Croix as synonyms
for Potsdam). The lower division appears on the Newfoundland
and Labrador coasts, and is traceable thence, in a great belt south-west
of those points, through Maine and the Hudson-Champlain
valley into Alabama, a distance of some 2000 m.; and the rocks
are brought up again on the western uplift, in Nevada, Idaho, Utah,
western Montana and British Columbia. The middle division covers
approximately the same region as the lower one, and in addition
it is found in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, and Arizona, in
western Montana, and possibly in western Wisconsin. The lower
division, in addition to covering the areas already indicated, spreads
over the interior of the United States.</p>

<p><i>Bohemia</i>.&mdash;The Cambrian rocks of this country are now recognized
by J.F. Pompesk; to comprise the Paradoxidian and Olenelledian
groups. They were made famous through the researches of Barrande.
The Cambrian system is covered by his stages &ldquo;B&rdquo; and &ldquo;C&rdquo;; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span>
former a barren series of conglomerates and quartzites, the latter
a series of grey and green fissile shales 1200 ft. thick with sandstones,
greywackes and conglomerates.</p>

<p><i>Scandinavia</i>.&mdash;Here the Cambrian system is only distinguished
clearly on the eastern side, where the three subdivisions are found
in a thin series of strata (400 ft.), in which black concretion-bearing
shales play an important part. Limestones and shales with the
<i>Euloma-Niobe</i> fauna come at the top. The upper series (<i>Olenus</i>)
has been minutely zoned by W.C. Br√∂gger, S.A. Tullberg and J.C.
Moberg. In the middle series (<i>Paradoxides</i>) three thin limestone
bands have been distinguished, the Fragmenten-Kalk, the Exulans-Kalk
and the Andrarums-Kalk.</p>

<p>On the Norwegian side the Cambrian is perhaps represented by
the R√∂ros schists which lie at the base of a great series of crystalline
schists, the probable equivalent of Ordovician and Silurian
rocks.</p>

<p><i>Baltic Province.</i>&mdash;The Cambrian rocks in this region are nearly all
soft sediments, some 600 ft. thick; they reach from the Gulf of
Finland towards Lake Ladoga. At the base is the so-called &ldquo;blue
clay&rdquo; (really greenish) with ferruginous sandstones and with a
fucoidal sandstone at its summit. This division is the equivalent
of the Lower Cambrian. Above the fucoidal sandstone an important
break appears in the system, for the <i>Paradoxides</i> and <i>Olenus</i>
divisions are absent. The upper members are the &ldquo;Ungulite grit&rdquo;
and about 20 ft. of Dictyonema shale. Cambrian rocks have been
traced into Siberia (lat. 71¬∞) and on the island of Vaigatch.</p>

<p><i>Central Europe.</i>&mdash;Besides the Bohemian region previously mentioned,
Cambrian rocks are present in Belgium and the north of
France, in Spain and the Th√ºringer Wald. In the Ardennes the
system is represented by grits and sandstones, shales, slates and
quartz schists, and includes also whet slates and some igneous rocks.
A. Dumont has arranged the whole series (<i>Terrain ardennais</i>) into
three systems, an upper &ldquo;Salmien,&rdquo; a middle &ldquo;Revinien&rdquo; and a
lower &ldquo;Devillien,&rdquo; but J. Gosselet has subsequently proposed to
unite the two lower groups in one.</p>

<p><i>France</i>.&mdash;-In northern France Cambrian rocks, mostly purple
conglomerates and red shales, rest with apparent unconformability
upon pre-Cambrian strata in Brittany, Normandy and northern
Poitou. In the Rennes basin limestones&mdash;often dolomitic&mdash;are
associated with quartzites and conglomerates; silicious limestones
also occur in the Sarthe region. Farther south, around the old
lands of Languedoc, equivalents of the two upper divisions of the
Cambrian have been recorded; and the uppermost members of the
system appear in Herault. Patches of Cambrian rocks are found
in the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>In <i>Spain</i> slates and quartzites, the slates of Rivadeo, more than
9000 ft. thick, are followed by the middle Cambrian beds of La Vega,
thick quartzites with limestone, slates and iron ores. Cambrian
rocks occur also in the provinces of Seville and Ciudad-Real. Upper
Cambrian strata have been found in upper Alemtejo in Portugal.</p>

<p>In <i>Russian Poland</i> is a series of conglomerates, quartzites and
shales; Some of the beds yield a <i>Paradoxides</i> fauna.</p>

<p>In the <i>Th√ºringer Wald</i> are certain strata, presumably Cambrian
since the uppermost beds contain the <i>Euloma-Niobe</i> fauna.</p>

<p><i>Sardinia</i> contains both middle and upper Cambrian. The Cambrian
system is represented in the Salt Range of India by the Neobolus
or Khussack beds, which may possibly belong to the middle
subdivision. The same group is probably represented in Corea
and the Liao-tung by
the thick &ldquo;Sinisian&rdquo;
formation of F. von
Richthofen.</p>

<p>In <i>South America</i>
upper Cambrian rocks
have been recorded from
north Argentina.</p>

<p>The Lower Cambrian
has been found at various
places in <i>South
Australia</i>; and in <i>Tasmania</i>
a thick series of
strata appears to be in
part at least of Upper
Cambrian age.</p>
</div>

<p><i>General Physical
Conditions in the Cambrian
Period.</i>&mdash;The
Cambrian rocks previously
described are all
such as would result
from deposition, in
comparatively shallow
seas, of the products
of degradation of land
surfaces by the ordinary
agents of denudation.
Evidences of shallow
water conditions are
abundant; very frequently
on the bedding
surfaces of sandstones
and other rocks we find cracks made by the sun&rsquo;s heat and
pittings caused by the showers that fell from the Cambrian sky,
and these records of the weather of this remote period are preserved
as sharply and clearly as those made only to-day on our
tidal reaches. Ripple marks and current bedding further point, to
the shallowness of the water at the places where the rocks were
made.</p>

<p>No Cambrian rocks are such as would be formed in the abysses
of the sea&mdash;although the absence of well-developed eyes in the
trilobites has led some to assume that this condition was an
indication that the creatures lived in abyssal depths.</p>

<p>At the close of the pre-Cambrian, many of the deposits of
that period must have been elevated into regions of fairly high
ground; this we may assume from the nature of the Cambrian
deposits which are mainly the product of the denudation of such
ground. Over the land areas thus formed, the seas in Cambrian
time gradually spread, laying down first the series known as
Lower Cambrian, then by further encroachment on the land the
wider spread Upper Cambrian deposits&mdash;in Europe, the middle
series is the most extensive. Consequently, Cambrian strata are
usually unconformable on older rocks.</p>

<p>During the general advance of the sea, local warpings of the
crust may have given rise to shallow lagoon or inland-lake conditions.
The common occurrence of red strata has been cited in
support of this view.</p>

<p>Compared with some other periods, the Cambrian was free
from extensive volcanic disturbances, but in Wales and in
Brittany the earlier portions of this period were marked by
voluminous outpourings; a condition that was feebly reflected
in central and southern Europe.</p>

<p>No definite conclusions can be drawn from the fossils as to the
climatic peculiarities of the earth in Cambrian times. The red
rocks may in some cases suggest desert conditions; and there is
good reason to suppose that in what are now Norway and China
a glacial cold prevailed early in the period.</p>

<p>Considerable variations occur in the thickness of Cambrian
deposits, which may generally be explained by the greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
rapidity of deposition in some areas than in others. Nothing
could be more striking than the difference between the thicknesses
in western and eastern Europe; in Brittany the deposits
are over 24,000 ft. thick, in Wales at least 12,000 ft., in western
England they are only 3000 ft., and in northern Scotland 2000 ft.,
while no farther east than Scandinavia the complete Cambrian
succession is only about 400 ft. thick. Again, in North America,
the greatest thicknesses are found along the mountainous regions
on the west and on the east&mdash;reaching 12,000 ft. in the latter
and probably nearly 40,000 ft. in the former (in British
Columbia)&mdash;while over the interior of the continent it is seldom
more than 1000 ft. thick.</p>

<p>Any attempt to picture the geographical conditions of the
Cambrian period must of necessity be very imperfect. It was
pointed out by Barrande that early in Palaeozoic Europe there
appeared two marine provinces&mdash;a northern one extending from
Russia to the British Isles through Scandinavia and northern
Germany, and a southern one comprising France, Bohemia, the
Iberian peninsula and Sardinia. It is assumed that some kind
of land barrier separated these two provinces. Further, there is
a marked likeness between the Cambrian of western Europe and
eastern America; many fossils of this period are common to
Britain, Sweden and eastern Canada; therefore it is likely that a
north Atlantic basin existed. Prof. Kayser suggests that there
was also a Pacific basin more extensive than at present; this is
borne out by the similarity between the Cambrian faunas of
China, Siberia and Argentina. The same author postulates an
Arctic continent, bordering upon northern Europe, Greenland
and North America; an African-Brazilian continent across the
present south Atlantic, and a marine communication between
Australia and India, where the faunas have much in common.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMBRIDGE, EARLS AND DUKES OF.<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> Under the Norman
and early Plantagenet kings of England the earldom of Cambridge
was united with that of Huntingdon, which was held
among others by David I., king of Scotland, as the husband of
earl Waltheof&rsquo;s daughter, Matilda. As a separate dignity the
earldom dates from about 1340, when William V., count (afterwards
duke) of Juliers, was created earl of Cambridge by King
Edward III.; and in 1362 (the year after William&rsquo;s death)
Edward created his own son, Edmund of Langley, earl of Cambridge,
the title being afterwards merged in that of duke of York,
which was bestowed upon Edmund in 1385. Edmund&rsquo;s elder
son, Edward, earl of Rutland, who succeeded his father as duke
of York and earl of Cambridge in 1402, appears to have resigned
the latter dignity in or before 1414, as in this year his younger
brother, Richard, was made earl of Cambridge. In the following
year Richard was executed for plotting against King Henry V.,
and his title was forfeited, but it was restored to his son, Richard,
who in 1415 became duke of York in succession to his uncle
Edward. Subsidiary to the dukedom of York the title was held
by Richard, and after his death in 1460 by his son Edward,
afterwards King Edward IV., becoming extinct on the fall of the
Yorkist dynasty.</p>

<p>In 1619 King James I., anxious to bestow an English title upon
James Hamilton, 2nd marquess of Hamilton (d. 1625), created
him earl of Cambridge, a title which came to his son and successor
James, 3rd marquess and first duke of Hamilton (d. 1649). In
1651 when William, 2nd duke of Hamilton, died, his English title
became extinct.</p>

<p>Again bestowed upon a member of the royal house, the title of
earl of Cambridge was granted in 1659 by Charles II. to his
brother Henry, duke of Gloucester, only to become extinct on
Henry&rsquo;s death in the following year. In 1661 Charles, the infant
son of James, duke of York, afterwards King James II., was
designated as marquess and duke of Cambridge, but the child
died before the necessary formalities were completed. However,
two of James&rsquo;s sons, James (d. 1667) and Edgar (d. 1671), were
actually created in succession dukes of Cambridge, but both died
in childhood. After the passing of the Act of Settlement in 1701
it was proposed to grant an English title to George Augustus,
electoral prince of Hanover, who, after his grandmother, the
electress Sophia, and his father, the elector George Louis, was
heir to the throne of England; and to give effect to this proposal
George Augustus was created marquess and duke of Cambridge
in November 1706. The title lapsed when he became king of
Great Britain and Ireland in 1727, but it was revived in 1801 in
favour of Adolphus Frederick, the seventh son of George III. He
and his son are dealt with below.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Adolphus Frederick</span>, duke of Cambridge (1774-1850), was
born in London on the 24th of February 1774. Having studied
at the university of G√∂ttingen, Adolphus Frederick served in the
Hanoverian and British armies, and, in November 1801, was
created earl of Tipperary and duke of Cambridge, becoming a
member of the privy council in the following year. The duke is
chiefly known for his connexion with Hanover. In 1815, on the
conclusion of the war, the electorate of Hanover was raised to
the rank of a kingdom, and in the following year the duke was
appointed viceroy. He held this position until the separation of
Great Britain and Hanover in 1837, and displaying tact and
moderation, appears to have ruled the country with great success
during a difficult period. Returning to England the duke became
very popular, and was active in supporting many learned and
benevolent societies. He died in London on the 8th of July 1850.
In 1818 he married Augusta (1797-1889), daughter of Frederick,
landgrave of Hesse-Cassel. He left three children: his successor,
George; Augusta Caroline (b. 1822), who married Frederick
William, grand duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz; and Mary Adelaide
(1833-1897), who married Francis, duke of Teck.</p>

<p><span class="sc">George William Frederick Charles</span>, duke of Cambridge
(1819-1904), was born at Hanover on the 26th of
March 1819. He was thus about two months older than his
cousin, Queen Victoria, and was for that period in the line of
succession to the British throne. He was educated at Hanover
by the Rev. J.R. Wood, a canon of Worcester. In November
1837, after he had served for a short time in the Hanoverian
army, the rank of colonel in the British army was conferred upon
him, and he was attached to the staff at Gibraltar from October
1838 to April 1839. After serving in Ireland with the 12th
Royal Lancers, he was appointed in April 1842 colonel of the
17th Light Dragoons (now Lancers). From 1843 to 1845 he
was colonel on the staff in the Ionian Islands, and was then
promoted major-general. In October 1846 he took command
of the Limerick district, and shortly afterwards of the Dublin
district. In 1850 his father died, and he succeeded to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>90</span>
dukedom. Being appointed inspector of cavalry in 1852, he held
that post until 1854, when, upon the outbreak of the Crimean
War, he was placed in command of the 1st division (Guards and
Highland brigades) of the British army in the East. In June
of the same year he was promoted lieutenant-general. He was
present at the battles of the Alma, Balaklava and Inkerman,
and at the siege of Sevastopol. On the 15th of July 1856 he was
appointed general commanding-in-chief, on the 9th of November
1862 field marshal, and by letters patent, 1887, commander-in-chief.
The long period during which he held the command
of the army was marked by many changes. The Crimean War
brought to light great administrative defects, and led to a regrouping
of the departments, which, with the whole personnel
of the army, were brought under the authority of the secretary
of state for war. The constitutional changes involved did not,
however, affect seriously the organization of the military forces.
Only in 1870, after the successes of Prussia had created a profound
impression, were drastic changes introduced by Cardwell
into the entire fabric of the army. The objects of the reformers
of 1870 were undoubtedly wise; but some of the methods
adopted were open to question, and were strongly resented by
the duke of Cambridge, whose views were shared by the majority
of officers. Further changes were inaugurated in 1880, and again
the duke found much to criticize. His opinions stand recorded
in the voluminous evidence taken by the numerous bodies
appointed to inquire into the condition of the army. They show
a sound military judgment, and, as against innovations as such,
a strong attachment to the old regimental system. That this
judgment and this attachment were not so rigid as was generally
supposed is proved by his published correspondence. Throughout
the period of change, while protesting, the duke invariably
accepted and loyally endeavoured to carry out the measures
on which the government decided. In a memorandum addressed
to Mr Childers in 1880 he defined his attitude as follows:&mdash;
&ldquo;Should it appear, however, that for reasons of state policy it
is necessary that the contemplated changes should be made,
I am prepared to carry them out to the best of my ability.&rdquo;
This attitude he consistently maintained in all cases in which his
training and associations led him, rightly or wrongly, to deprecate
changes the need for which was not apparent to him. His
judgment was especially vindicated in the case of an ill-advised
reduction of the artillery carried out by Mr. Stanhope. Under
the order in council of February 1888, the whole responsibility
for military duties of every kind was for the first time centred
upon the commander-in-chief. This, as pointed out by the
Hartington commission in 1890, involved &ldquo;an excessive
centralization&rdquo; which &ldquo;must necessarily tend to weaken the
sense of responsibility of the other heads of departments, and
thus to diminish their efficiency.&rdquo; The duke of Cambridge, whose
position entailed many duties apart from those strictly appertaining
to a commander-in-chief, could not give personal attention
to the vast range of matters for which he was made nominally
responsible. On the other hand, the adjutant-general could
act in his name, and the secretary of state could obtain military
advice from officials charged with no direct responsibility.
The effect was to place the duke in a false position in the eyes
of the army and of the country. If the administration of
the army suffered after 1888, this was due to a system which
violated principles. His active control of its training during
the whole period of his command was less hampered, and more
directly productive of good results.</p>

<p>Throughout his long term of office the duke of Cambridge
evinced a warm interest in the welfare of the soldier, and great
experience combined with a retentive memory made him a
master of detail. He was famous for plain, and strong,
language; but while quick to condemn deviations from
the letter of regulations, and accustomed to insist upon great
precision in drill, he was never a martinet, and his natural
kindliness made him ready to bestow praise. Belonging to the
older generation of soldiers, he could not easily adapt himself
to the new conditions, and in dispensing patronage he was somewhat
distrustful of originality, while his position as a member of
the royal family tended to narrow his scope for selection. He
was thus inclined to be influenced by considerations of pure
seniority, and to underrate the claims of special ability. The
army, however, always recognized that in the duke of Cambridge
it had a commander-in-chief devoted to its interests, and keenly
anxious amid many difficulties to promote its well-being. The
duke resigned the commandership-in-chief on the 1st of November
1895, and was succeeded by Lord Wolseley, the duties of the
office being considerably modified. He was at the same time
gazetted honorary colonel-in-chief to the forces. He was made
ranger of Hyde Park and St James&rsquo;s Park in 1852, and of
Richmond Park in 1857; governor of the Royal Military
Academy in 1862, and its president in 1870, and personal aide-de-camp
to Queen Victoria in 1882. He died on the 17th of
March 1904 at Gloucester House, London. The chief honours
conferred upon him were: G.C.H., 1825; K.G., 1835; G.C.M.G.,
1845; G.C.B., 1855; K.P., 1861; K.T., 1881. From 1854 he
was president of Christ&rsquo;s hospital. The duke of Cambridge was
married to Louisa Fairbrother, who took the name of FitzGeorge
after her marriage. She died in 1890.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMBRIDGE, RICHARD OWEN<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> (1717-1802), English poet,
was born in London on the 14th of February 1717. He was
educated at Eton and at St John&rsquo;s College, Oxford. Leaving
the university without taking a degree, he took up residence at
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn in 1737. Four years later he married, and went to
live at his country seat of Whitminster, Gloucestershire. In
1751 he removed to Twickenham, where he enjoyed the society
of many notable persons. Horace Walpole in his letters makes
many jesting allusions to Cambridge in the character of
newsmonger.
He died at Twickenham on the 17th of September
1802. His chief work is the <i>Scribleriad</i> (1751), a mock epic
poem, the hero of which is the Martinus Scriblerus of Pope,
Arbuthnot and Swift. The poem is preceded by a dissertation
on the mock heroic, in which he avows Cervantes as his master.
The satire shows considerable learning, and was eagerly read
by literary people; but it never became popular, and the
allusions, always obscure, have little interest for the present-day
reader. He made a valuable contribution to history in his
<i>Account of the War in India...on the Coast of Coromandel
from the year 1750 to 1760...</i> (1761). He had intended to write
a history of the rise and progress of British power in India,
but this enterprise went no further than the work just named,
as he found that Robert Orme, who had promised him the use
of his papers, contemplated the execution of a similar plan.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMBRIDGE,<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> a municipal and parliamentary borough, the
seat of a university, and the county town of Cambridgeshire,
England, 56 m. N. by E. of London by the Great Eastern
railway, served also by the Great Northern, London &amp; North-Western
and Midland lines. Pop. (1901) 38,379. It lies in a flat
plain at the southern border of the low Fen country, at an
elevation of only 30 to 50 ft. above sea-level. The greater part of
the town is situated on the east (right) bank of the Cam, a
tributary of the Ouse, but suburbs extend across the river. To
the south and west the slight hills bordering the fenland rise
gently. The parliamentary borough of Cambridge returns one
member. The municipal borough is under a mayor, 12 aldermen,
and 36 councillors. Area, 3233 acres.</p>

<p>Cambridge University<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> shares with that of Oxford the first
place among such institutions in the British empire. It is the
dominating factor in the modern importance of
the town, and it is therefore necessary to outline
<span class="sidenote"> <i>History</i></span>
the historical conditions which led to its establishment. The
geographical situation of Cambridge, in its present appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>91</span>
possessing little attraction or advantage, calls nevertheless for
first consideration. Cambridge, in fact, owed its growth to its
position on a natural line of communication between the east and
the midlands of England, flanked on the one hand by the deep
forests which covered the uplands, on the other by the unreclaimed
fens, then desolate and in great part impenetrable. The importance
of this highway may be judged from the number of early
earthworks in the vicinity of Cambridge; and the Castle Hill, at
the north side of the present town (near the west bank of the
river), is perhaps a British work. Roman remains discovered in
the same locality give evidence of the existence of a small town
or village at the junction of roads; the name of <i>Camboritum</i> is
usually attached to it, but without certainty. The modern name
of Cambridge has no connexion with this. The present form of
the name has usually been derived from a corruption of the
original name Grantebrycge or Grantabridge (Skeat); but Mr
Arthur Gray points out that there is no documentary evidence
for this corruption in the shape of such probable intermediate
forms as Grantebrig or Crantebrig. On the other hand, he brings
evidence to show that the name Cantebrig, though not applied to
the whole town, was very early given to that quarter of it near
the Cante brig, <i>i.e.</i> the bridge over the Cante (the ward beyond
the Great Bridge was called &ldquo;Parcelle of Cambridge&rdquo; as late as
1340); in this quarter, close to the bridge, Cambridge castle was
built by the Conqueror, and from the castle and the castle-quarter
the name spread within sixty years to the whole town,
the similarity between the names Grantebrig and Cantebrig
playing some part in this extension (<i>The Dual Origin of the Town
of Cambridge</i>, p. 31). Granta is the earlier and still an alternative
name of the river Cam, this more common modern form having
been adopted in sympathy with the modern name of the town.
Cambridge had a further importance from its position at the head
of river navigation, and a charter of Henry I., in which the town
is already referred to as a borough, grants it exclusive rights as
a river-port, and regulates traffic and tolls. The wharves lay
principally along that part of the river where are now the
celebrated &ldquo;backs&rdquo; of some of the colleges, whose exquisite
grounds slope down to the water. The great Sturbridge or
Stourbridge Fair at Barnwell, formerly one of the most important
in England, is a further illustration of the ancient commercial
importance of Cambridge; the oldest known charter concerning
it dates from the opening of the 13th century, though its initiation
may perhaps be placed a century before.</p>

<p>Concerning the early municipal history of Cambridge little is
known, but at the time of the Domesday survey its citizens felt
themselves strong enough to protest against the exactions of the
Norman sheriff, Roger Picot; and the town had attained a
considerable degree of importance when, in 1068, William the
Conqueror built a castle on the site known as Castle Hill, and used
it as a base of operations against Hereward the Wake and the
insurgents of the fenland. Cambridge, however, has practically
no further military history. From the 14th century onward
materials were taken from the castle by the builders of colleges,
while the gatehouse, the last surviving portion, was removed in
1842.</p>

<p>The medieval spirit of emulation between the universities of
Cambridge and Oxford resulted in a series of remarkable fables
to account for the foundation of both. That of Cambridge was
assigned to a Spanish prince, Cantaber, in the 4321st year after
the Creation. A charter from King Arthur dated 531, and the
transference of students from Cambridge to Oxford by King
Alfred, were also claimed as historical facts. The true germ of
the university is to be sought in the religious foundations in the
town. The earliest to be noticed is the Augustinian house of St
Giles, founded by Hugoline, wife of Roger Picot the sheriff, in
1092; this was removed in 1112 to Barnwell, where the chapel
dedicated to St Andrew the Less is practically the sole remnant
of its buildings. In 1224 the Franciscans came to Cambridge,
and later in the same century a number of other religious orders
settled here, such as the Dominicans, the Gilbertines and the
Carmelites, who had before been established at Newnham.
Students were gradually attracted to these several religious
houses, and Cambridge was already recognized as a centre of
learning when, in 1231, Henry III. issued a writ for its governance
as such, among other provisions conferring certain disciplinary
powers on the bishop of Ely. It soon became evident that the
influence of the religious orders on those who came to them for
instruction was too narrow. This was recognized elsewhere, for
it was in order to counteract that influence that Walter de
Merton drew up the statute of governance for his foundation of
Merton College, Oxford, a statute which was soon afterwards
used as a model by Hugh de Balsham, bishop of Ely, when, in
1281-1284 he founded the first Cambridge college, Peterhouse.</p>

<p>The friction between town and university, due in the main to
the conflict of their jurisdictions, the tradition of which, as in the
sister university, died hard in the annual efforts of some undergraduates
to revive the &ldquo;town and gown&rdquo; riots, culminated
during the rebellion of Wat Tyler (1381) in an episode which is
alone worthy of record and may serve to illustrate the whole.
This was an attack by the rabble, instigated, it is said, by the
more reputable townspeople, on the colleges, several of which
were sacked. The attack was ultimately defeated by the courage
and resource of Henry Spenser or Le Dispencer, bishop of
Norwich. The relations of the university of Cambridge with the
crown were never so intimate as those of Oxford. Henry III.
fortified the town with two gates, but these were burnt by the
rebellious barons; and in much later times the two first of the
Stuart kings, and the two first of the Georges, cultivated friendly
personal relations with the university. During the civil war the
colleges even melted down their plate for the war chest of King
Charles; but Cambridge showed little of the stubborn royalism
of Oxford, and submitted to the Commonwealth without serious
resistance.</p>

<p>The history of collegiate foundation in Cambridge after that of
Peterhouse may be followed through the ensuing description of
the colleges, but for ease of reference these are dealt
with in alphabetical order. The main street which
<span class="sidenote">Colleges.</span>
traverses the town from south to north, parallel to, and at a
short distance from the river, is known successively as Trumpington
Street, King&rsquo;s Parade, Trinity Street, St John&rsquo;s Street and
Bridge Street. The majority of the colleges lie on either side of
this street, and chiefly between it and the river. Those of St
John&rsquo;s, Trinity, Trinity Hall, Clare, King&rsquo;s and Queens&rsquo; present
the famous &ldquo;backs&rdquo; towards the river, which is crossed by a
series of picturesque bridges leading to the gardens and grounds
on the opposite bank.</p>

<p><i>Christ&rsquo;s College</i> is not among the group indicated above; it
stands farther to the east, in St Andrew&rsquo;s Street. It was founded
in 1505 by the Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII.
It incorporated God&rsquo;s House, which had been founded by
William Bingham, a cleric of London, in 1439, had been removed
when the site was required for part of King&rsquo;s College, and had
been refounded with the countenance of Henry VI. in 1448.
This was a small house, but the Lady Margaret&rsquo;s endowment
provided for a master, twelve fellows and forty-seven scholars.
Edward VI. added another fellowship and three scholarships
and the present number of fellows is fifteen. There are certain
exhibitions in election to which preference is given to schools
in the north of England&mdash;Giggleswick, Kirkby Lonsdale, Skipton
and Sedbergh. The buildings of Lady Margaret&rsquo;s foundation
were in great part faced in classical style in the 17th century;
a building east of the old quadrangle is also of this period, and
is ascribed to Inigo Jones. The rooms occupied by the foundress
herself are preserved, though in an altered condition, as are
those of the poet Milton, who was educated here, and with whom
the college has many associations. In the fine gardens is an
ancient mulberry tree believed to have been planted by him.
Among illustrious names connected with this college are John
Leland the antiquary, Archdeacon Paley, author of the <i>Evidences</i>,
and Charles Darwin, while Henry More and others of the school
of Cambridge Platonists in the 17th century were educated here.</p>

<p><i>Clare College</i> lies close to the river, south of Trinity Hall. In
1326 the university erected a hall, known as University Hall, to
accommodate a number of students, and in 1338 Elizabeth de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span>
Burgh, countess of Clare, re-endowed the hall, which took the
name of Clare Hall, and only became known as college in 1856.
There was a strong ecclesiastical tendency in this foundation;
six out of the twenty fellows were to be priests when elected.
The foundation now consists of a master and fifteen fellows,
besides scholars, of whom three receive emoluments from the
endowment of Lady Clare. The old college buildings were in
great part destroyed by fire in 1521; the present buildings
date from 1638 to 1715, and are admirable examples of their
period. They surround a very beautiful quadrangle, and the
back towards the river is also fine. Unconfirmed tradition
indicates the poet Chaucer as an <i>alumnus</i> of this college; other
famous men associated with it were Hugh Latimer the martyr,
Ralph Cudworth, one of the &ldquo;Platonists,&rdquo; and Archbishop
Tillotson.</p>

<p><i>Corpus Christi College</i> (commonly called Corpus) stands
on the east side of Trumpington Street. The influence of
medieval gilds in Cambridge, the character of which was
primarily religious, was exceedingly strong. About the beginning
of the 14th century there is first mentioned the gild of
St Mary, which was connected with Great St Mary&rsquo;s church.
The gild was at this time prosperous, but about 1350, when
the idea of the foundation of a college by the gilds was matured,
the fraternity of St Mary lacked the means to proceed save by
amalgamating with another gild, that of Corpus Christi. The
age of this institution, whose church was St Benedict&rsquo;s or St
Bene&rsquo;t&rsquo;s, is not known. By the two gilds, therefore, the &ldquo;House
of Scholars of Corpus Christi and the Blessed Virgin Mary&rdquo;
was founded in 1352, the foundation being the only instance
of its kind. In early times it was commonly known as St Bene&rsquo;t&rsquo;s
from the church connected with the Corpus gild which stands over
against the college, and served as its chapel for nearly three
centuries. The foundation consists of a master and twelve
fellows, with scholars of the old and later foundations. The
ancient small quadrangle remains, and is of historical rather
than architectural interest. The great quadrangle dates from
1823-1825. The library contains the famous collection of MSS.
bequeathed by Archbishop Matthew Parker, <i>alumnus</i> of the
college, in the 16th century.</p>

<p><i>Downing College</i> is in the southern part of the town, to the
east of Trumpington Street. Sir George Downing, baronet, of
Gamlingay Park, who died in 1749, left estates to various
relations, who died without issue. In this event, Downing&rsquo;s will
provided for the foundation of a college, but the heirs contested
the will with the university, and in spite of a decision against
them in 1769, continued to hold the estates for many years, so
that it was not until 1800 that the charter for the college was
obtained. The foundation-stone was laid in 1807, and the two
ranges of buildings, in classical style, represent all that was
completed of an intended quadrangle. The foundation consists
of a master, professors of English law and of medicine, six
fellows and six scholars.</p>

<p><i>Emmanuel College</i> overlooks St Andrew&rsquo;s Street. It was
founded in 1584 by Sir Walter Mildmay (<i>c</i>. 1520-1589), chancellor
of the exchequer and privy councillor under Queen Elizabeth.
The foundation, considerably enlarged from the original, consists
of a master, sixteen fellows and thirty scholars. There are further
scholarships on other foundations which are awarded by preference
to pupils of Uppingham and other schools in the midlands.
Emmanuel was noted from the outset as a stronghold of Puritanism;
it is indeed recorded that Elizabeth rallied the founder
on his intention that this should be so. Mildmay assuredly had
the welfare of the church primarily at heart, and he attempted
to provide against the life residence of fellows, which he considered
an unhealthy feature in some colleges. The site of
Emmanuel was previously occupied by a Dominican friary,
and some of its buildings were adapted to collegiate uses. There
is only a little of the earliest building remaining; the greater
part of the present college dates from the second half of the
18th century. The chapel, however, is by Sir Christopher Wren
(1677). Richard Holdsworth, Gresham professor, and William
Sancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, were masters of this college;
Bishops Joseph Hall and Thomas Percy were among its <i>alumni</i>,
as was John Harvard, principal founder of the great American
college which bears his name.</p>

<p><i>Gonville and Caius College</i> (commonly called Caius, pronounced
Kees), stands mainly on the west side of Trinity Street. It arose
out of an earlier foundation. In 1348 Edmund Gonvile or Gonevill
founded the hall of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin, which
was commonly called Gonville Hall, for the education of twenty
scholars in dialectic and other sciences, with endowment for
a master and three fellows. This hall stood on part of the present
site of Corpus, but on the death of its founder in 1351 it was
moved to the north-west corner of the site of the present Caius,
by William Bateman, bishop of Norwich and founder of Trinity
Hall. The famous physician John Caius (<i>q.v.</i>), who was educated
at this small institution, later conceived the idea of refounding
and enlarging it, obtained a charter to do so in 1557, and became
master of the new foundation of Gonville and Caius College.
The foundation consists of a master and not less than
twenty-two
fellows, exclusive of the provision under the will of William
Henry Drosier (d. 1889), doctor of medicine and fellow of the
college, for the endowment of seven additional fellowships.
Since its refoundation by Caius, the college has had a peculiar
connexion with the study of medicine, while, besides many
eminent physicians, Sir Thomas Gresham, Judge Jeffreys,
Robert Hare, Jeremy Taylor, Henry Wharton and Lord Thurlow
are among its noted names. Three sides of the main quadrangle,
Tree Court, including the frontage towards Trinity Street, are
modern (1870). The interior of this court is picturesque, and
the design of the smaller Caius Court was inspired by Caius
himself. He also designed the gates of Honour, Virtue and
Humility, of which the two first stand <i>in situ</i>; the gate of
Honour is a peculiarly good example of early Renaissance work.
Caius is buried in the chapel.</p>

<p><i>Jesus College</i> lies apart from and to the north-east of the
majority of the colleges. It was founded in 1406 by John
Alcock, bishop of Ely. The site was previously occupied by a
Benedictine nunnery dedicated to St Radigund, which was
already in existence in the first half of the 12th century and was
claimed by Alcock to have been founded from Ely, to the bishops
of which it certainly owed much. The name given to Alcock&rsquo;s
college was that of &ldquo;the most Blessed Virgin Mary, St John the
Evangelist, and the glorious Virgin Saint Radigund,&rdquo; but it
appears that the founder himself intended the name to be Jesus
College. He provided for a master and six fellows, but the
foundation now consists of a master and sixteen fellows, with
twenty scholars or more. There are several further scholarships
confined to the sons of clergymen of the Church of England.
Architecturally Jesus is one of the most interesting colleges in
Cambridge, for Alcock retained, and there still remains, a considerable
part of the old buildings of the nunnery. The most
important of these is the church, which Alcock, by removing
most of the nave and other portions, converted into the usual
form of a college chapel. The tower, however, is retained. The
bulk of the building is an admirable example of Early English
work, but there are traces of Norman; and Alcock added certain
Perpendicular features. Of the rest of the college buildings,
the hall is Alcock&rsquo;s work, the brick gatehouse is a fine structure
of the close of the 15th century, while the cloister is a little later,
and stands on the site of the nuns&rsquo; cloister. Another court dates
from the 17th and early 18th centuries, and there is a considerable
amount of modern building. The most famous name connected
with Jesus College is that of Cranmer. Among many others are
Sir Thomas Elyot, John Bale, John Pearson, bishop of Chester,
Hugh Peters, Gilbert Wakefield, Thomas Malthus, Laurence
Sterne and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.</p>

<p><i>King&rsquo;s College</i> has its fine frontage upon the western side of
King&rsquo;s Parade. It was founded by King Henry VI. in 1441.
The first site was small and circumscribed, and in 1443 the existing
site was with difficulty cleared of dwellings. The king designed
a close connexion between this college and his other foundation
at Eton; he provided for a provost and for seventy scholars,
all of whom should be Etonians. In 1861 open scholarships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span>
were instituted, and the foundation now consists of a provost,
forty-six fellows and forty-eight scholars. Half the scholarships
are still appropriated to Eton. An administrative arrangement
peculiar to King&rsquo;s College is that by which the provost has
absolute authority within its walls, to the exclusion of officers
of the University. The chief architectural ornament of the
college, and one of the most notable in the town, is the magnificent
Perpendicular chapel, comparable with those of St George
at Windsor and Henry VII. at Westminster Abbey. The
building was begun in 1446, and extended (apart from the
interior fittings) over nearly seventy years. Within, the most
splendid features are the fan-vaulting which extends throughout
the chapel, the noble range of stained-glass windows, which
date for the most part from the early part of the 16th century,
and the wooden organ screen, which, with part of the stalls, is
of the time of Henry VIII. The college services are celebrated
for the beauty of their music. The bulk of the other collegiate
buildings are of the 18th century or modern. The old court
of King&rsquo;s College is occupied by the modern university library,
north of the chapel; the gateway, a good example (1444), is
preserved. John Frith the Martyr, Richard Croke, Giles
Fletcher, Richard Mulcaster, Sir William Temple, William
Oughtred, the poet Waller, and Horace Walpole and others of
his family are among many illustrious <i>alumni</i> of the college.</p>

<p><i>Magdalene College</i> (pronounced Maudlin) stands on the west
bank of the Cam, near the Great Bridge. In 1428 the Benedictines
of Crowland Abbey founded a home for student monks
on this site, and in 1519 Edward, duke of Buckingham, partly
secularized this institution by founding Buckingham College
in connexion with it. After the dissolution of the monastery,
Thomas, Baron Audley of Walden, erected Magdalene in place
of the former house in 1542. The foundation consists of a
master and seven fellows, besides scholars. There are some
valuable exhibitions appropriated to Wisbech school. The
appointment of the master is peculiar, the office being in the gift
of the occupant of Audley End, an estate near Saffron Walden,
Essex. Some parts of the original building are preserved, but
the most notable portion of the college is the Pepysian library,
dating <i>c</i>. 1700. It contains the very valuable collection of books
bequeathed by Samuel Pepys to the college, at which he was a
student. Buckingham College had Archbishop Cranmer as a
lecturer; Charles Kingsley and Charles Stewart Parnell were
educated at Magdalene.</p>

<p><i>Pembroke College</i> stands to the east of Trumpington Street.
It was founded in 1347 by Mary de St Paul, widow of Aylmer
de Valence, earl of Pembroke. Henry VI. made notable benefactions
to it. The foundation consists of a master and thirteen
fellows, and there are six scholarships on the original foundation,
besides others of later institution. The older existing buildings
are mainly of the 18th century, but much of the original fabric
was removed and rebuilt in 1874. The chapel is of the middle of
the 17th century, and is ascribed to Sir Christopher Wren. The
poets Spenser and Gray, Nicholas Ridley the martyr, Archbishop
Whitgift and William Pitt were associated with this college;
and from the number of bishops whose names are associated
with it the college has obtained the style of <i>collegium episcopale</i>.</p>

<p><i>Peterhouse</i> or St Peter&rsquo;s College is on the west side of Trumpington
Street, almost opposite Pembroke. It has already been
indicated as the oldest Cambridge college (1284). Hugh de
Balsham, the founder, had settled some secular scholars in the
ancient Augustinian Hospital of St John in 1280, but the experiment
was not a success. Nor did he carry out his full intentions
as regards Peterhouse, the foundation of which followed on the
failure of the fusion of his scholars with the hospital; but
Simon Montagu, his successor in the bishopric of Ely, carried
on his work, and in 1344 gave the college a code of statutes in
which the influence of the Merton code is plainly visible. A
master and fourteen fellows formed the original foundation, but
the present consists of a master, and not less than eleven fellows
and twenty-three scholars. The hall retains some original work;
it was first built out of a legacy from the founder. The library
building (<i>c</i>. 1590) is due to a legacy from Dr Andrew Perne
(master 1554-1580); and Dr Matthew Wren (master 1625-1634),
uncle of the famous architect Sir Christopher Wren, directed
the building of the chapel and cloisters. The most famous name
connected with the college is that of Cardinal Beaufort.</p>

<p><i>Queens&rsquo; College</i> stands at the south of the riverside group, and
one of its ranges of buildings rises immediately from the river.
A college of St Bernard had been established in 1445 by Andrew
Docket or Dokett, rector of St Botolph&rsquo;s church, who had also
been principal of a hostel, or students&rsquo; lodge, of St Bernard.
He sought and obtained the patronage of Margaret of Anjou,
wife of Henry VI., who undertook the foundation of a new house
on another site in 1448, to bear the name of Queens&rsquo;. Docket
became the first master. In 1465 Elizabeth Woodville, wife of
Edward IV., became the college&rsquo;s second foundress. The
foundation consists of a president and eleven fellows. The
buildings are exceedingly picturesque. The main quadrangle,
of red brick, was completed very soon after the foundation.
The smaller cloister court, towards the river, retains building
of the same period, and the beautiful wooden gallery of the
president&rsquo;s lodge deserves notice. Another court is called
Erasmus&rsquo;s; the rooms which he is said to have occupied remain,
and a walk in the college garden across the river bears his name.</p>

<p><i>St Catharine&rsquo;s College</i>, on the west side of Trumpington Street,
was founded by Dr Robert Woodlark or Wodelarke, chancellor
of the university and (1452) provost of King&rsquo;s College. It was
opened in 1473, but the charter of incorporation dates from 1475.
The foundation provided for a master (Woodlark being the first)
and three fellows; there are now six fellows, and twenty-six
scholars. The principal buildings, surrounding a court on three
sides, date mainly from a complete reconstruction of the college
at the close of the 17th century.</p>

<p><i>St John&rsquo;s College</i>, at the north of the riverside group of colleges,
was founded in 1511 by the Lady Margaret Beaufort, also
foundress of Christ&rsquo;s College. It replaced the Hospital of St
John, which dated from the early years of the 13th century,
and has been mentioned already in connexion with Peterhouse.
The Lady Margaret died before the college was firmly established,
and her designs were not carried out without many difficulties,
which were overcome chiefly by the exertions of John Fisher,
bishop of Rochester, one of her executors. Thirty-two fellowships
were endowed, but subsequent endowments allowed
extension, and the foundation now consists of a master, fifty-six
fellows, sixty scholars and nine sizars. A large number of
exhibitions are appropriated to special schools. Of the four
courts of St John&rsquo;s, the easternmost is the original, and has a very
fine Tudor gateway of brick. The chapel is modern (1863-1869),
an ornate example of the work of Sir Gilbert Scott. The second
court, practically unaltered, dates from 1508-1602. In this there
is a beautiful Masters&rsquo; gallery, panelled, with a richly-moulded
ceiling; it is now used as a combination room or fellows&rsquo; common-room.
The third court, which contains the library (1624), backs
on to the river, and the fourth, which is on the opposite bank,
was built <i>c</i>. 1830. A covered bridge connects the two, and is
commonly called the Bridge of Sighs from a certain resemblance
to the bridge of that name at Venice. Among the notable names
connected with this college are Cecil, Lord Burghley, Thomas
Cartwright, Wentworth, earl of Strafford, Roger Ascham,
Richard Bentley, John Cleveland, the satirist, Thomas Baker, the
historian, Lord Palmerston, Professor Adams, Sir John Herschel,
Bishop Colenso, Dr Benjamin Kennedy, Dean Merivale, Horne
Tooke, Samuel Parr and William Wilberforce, and the poets
Herrick (afterwards of Trinity Hall) and Wordsworth.</p>

<p><i>Selwyn College</i>, standing west of the river (Sidgwick Avenue),
was founded in 1882 by public subscription in memory of George
Augustus Selwyn, bishop of New Zealand and afterwards of
Lichfield, for the purpose of giving university education with
economy &ldquo;combined,&rdquo; according to the charter, &ldquo;with Christian
training, based upon the principles of the Church of England.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Sidney Sussex College</i> faces Sidney Street. It was founded
under the will (1588) of the Lady Frances Sidney, dowager
countess of Sussex (d. 1589), and received its charter in 1596.
The foundress provided for a master, ten fellows and twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
scholars, but thirty-six scholarships are now provided. The
original buildings were of brick, but they were plastered over
and greatly altered by Wyatville about 1830. The Grey Friars
had occupied the site, and part of their buildings remained in
the chapel until 1777. A beautiful block of new buildings,
with a cloister, was erected in 1890. The most famous name
associated with the college is that of Oliver Cromwell, who was
a fellow commoner, as also was Thomas Fuller, author of the
<i>Worthies of England</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trinity College</i>, the front of which is on Trinity Street, is the
largest collegiate foundation in Cambridge, and larger than any
in Oxford. It was founded in 1546 by King Henry VIII. and
absorbed several earlier institutions&mdash;King&rsquo;s Hall (founded
by Edward III. in 1336), St Michael&rsquo;s or Michaelhouse (founded
by  Hervey de Stanton, chancellor of the exchequer under
Edward II., in 1323), Fyswick or Physick&rsquo;s Hostel, belonging
to Gonville Hall, and other hostels. Henry&rsquo;s original foundation
was for a master and sixty fellows and scholars, but Queen
Mary and other later benefactors enabled extensions to be made,
and the foundation now consists of a master (appointed by the
crown), at least sixty fellows, seventy-four scholars and sixteen
sizars, with minor scholars, chaplains librarian and the regius
professors of Divinity, Hebrew and Greek. Major scholarships
are open to undergraduates, not being of standing to take the
degree of bachelor of arts, as well as to non-members of the
university under nineteen years of age, while minor scholarships
and exhibitions are open only to the latter. There are valuable
exhibitions appropriated to certain schools, of which the most
important are those confined to Westminster school. Trinity
College is entered from Trinity Street by the King&rsquo;s Gateway
(1518-1535) preserved from King&rsquo;s Hall, but subsequently
altered. The principal or Great Court is the largest in Cambridge
and very fine. Its buildings are of different dates. In the centre
is a picturesque fountain, erected by Thomas Neville, master
(1593-1615), under whose direction much of the building was
carried out. The chapel on the north side of the court was
begun in the reign of Mary. The carved oak fittings within
date from the mastership of Richard Bentley (1700-1742). The
organ is particularly fine. A statue of Sir Isaac Newton by
Roubiliac stands in the antechapel, and Richard  Porson and
William Whewell are buried here. The hall on the west of the
court is Neville&rsquo;s work (1605), and very beautiful. The second
court is also his foundation and bears his name. The library
on the west side is the work of Sir Christopher Wren. Its interior
is excellent, and besides busts of some of the vast number of
famous men connected with Trinity, it contains a statue of Lord
Byron by the Danish sculptor Thorvaldsen. The New Court,
Gothic in style, was begun in 1823. The beautiful grounds and
walks of the college extend down to and beyond the river.
The college has extended its buildings to the opposite side of
Trinity Street, where the two courts known as Whewell&rsquo;s Hostel
were built (c. 1860) at the charge of Dr William Whewell during
his mastership. The eminent <i>alumni</i> of this great college are
too numerous to admit of selection.</p>

<p><i>Trinity Hall,</i> which lies near the river, south of Trinity, was
founded by William Bateman, bishop of Norwich, in 1350. On
the site there had been, for about twenty years before the foundation,
a house of monastic students from Ely. The present college
is alone in preserving the term Hall in its title. The foundation
consists of a master and thirteen fellows, and the study of law,
which the founder had especially in mind, is provided for by
lectureships, and not less than three studentships tenable by
graduates of the college. The buildings are for the most part
modern or modernized, but the interior of the library well
preserves its character of the early part of the 17th century.</p>

<p>Of the churches of Cambridge one has long been recognized as
the church of the university, namely Great St Mary&rsquo;s, which
stands in the centre of the town, between King&rsquo;s
Parade and Market Hill. It is a fine Perpendicular
<span class="sidenote">University buildings.</span>
structure, founded in 1478; but the tower was not
completed until 1608. Some Decorated details are preserved
from a former building. The university preachers deliver their
sermons in this church, but it was formerly the meeting-place
of the university for the transaction of business, for learned
disputations and for secular festivals. The &ldquo;Cambridge
chimes&rdquo; struck by the clock are famous, and a curfew is rung
each evening on the great bell. The Senate House, standing
opposite Great St Mary&rsquo;s, dates from 1730 and is classical in
style. The buildings of the university library, in the immediate
vicinity, enclose two quadrangles, and in part occupy the site
of the old court of King&rsquo;s College. One of the quadrangles
was formerly occupied by the schools or lecture rooms, but as
the library grew it usurped their place. Important modern additions
date from 1842, 1864 and 1888. The facade of the old
schools is an excellent work of 1758. The library is one of those
which is entitled to receive, under the Copyright Act, a copy of
every book published in the United Kingdom. The Fitzwilliam
Museum, a massive classical building, was begun in 1837 to
contain the bibliographical and art collection bequeathed by
Richard, Viscount Fitzwilliam, in 1816. The museum of
archaeology (classical, general and local, 1884), is connected
with the Fitzwilliam Museum. The Pitt Press (1833), housing
the university printing establishment, was begun out of the
residue of a fund for erecting the statues of William Pitt in
Hanover Square, London, and Westminster Abbey. It stands
near Pembroke, Pitt&rsquo;s college. The Selwyn Divinity School
(1879), opposite St John&rsquo;s College, was built largely at the charge
of Dr William Selwyn, Lady Margaret professor of divinity.
The museums and lecture rooms (begun in 1863) are extensive
buildings on each side of Downing Street. Included in these
are the museum of zoology, which had its origin in collections
made by Sir Busick Harwood, professor of anatomy in
1785-1814, and contains the collection of fishes made by
Charles Darwin in the ship &ldquo;Beagle&rdquo;; the medical school,
botanical museum and herbarium, mineralogical museum,
engineering laboratory (1894), optical and astronomical lecture
room, chemical laboratory (1887), and the Cavendish laboratory
for physical research (1874), the gift of William Cavendish,
7th duke of Devonshire and chancellor of the university. The
Sedgwick Geological Museum, opened by King Edward VII.
in 1904, commemorates Adam Sedgwick, Woodwardian professor
of geology, and originated in the collections of Dr
John Woodward (d. 1728). Adjoining this building, in Downing
Street is the law library, founded on a bequest from Miss
Rebecca Flower Squire (d. 1898) with the law school. The
observatory (1824) is on the outskirts of the town in Madingley
Road, and the botanic garden (founded 1762, and removed
to its present site in 1831) borders Trumpington Road. The
club-rooms and debating hall of the Cambridge Union Society
are adjacent to the Holy Sepulchre church.</p>

<p>The non-collegiate students of the university (<i>i.e.</i> those who
receive the university education and possess the same status as
collegiate students without belonging to any college) have
lecture and other rooms and a library in Fitzwilliam Hall. This
body was created in 1869. The students reside in lodgings.
There are two women&rsquo;s colleges&mdash;Girton, established in 1873 on
the north-western outskirts of the town, having been previously
opened at Hitchin in 1869, and Newnham (1875), originally (1873)
a hall of residence for students attending special lectures for
women. Among other educational establishments mention must
be made of the Leys school, founded in 1875 by prominent Wesleyans
for non-sectarian education, and the Perse School, an
ancient foundation remodelled in 1902.</p>

<p>Out of a number of ancient churches in Cambridge, two,
besides Great St Mary&rsquo;s, deserve special notice. In St Benedict&rsquo;s
or Benet&rsquo;s, which has been already mentioned
in connexion with Corpus College, the tower is of
<span class="sidenote">Non-university buildings.</span>
great interest, being the oldest surviving building in
Cambridge, of pre-Norman workmanship, having rude
ornamentation on the exterior and the tower arch within. The
church of the Holy Sepulchre in Bridge Street is one of the four
ancient round churches in England. Its supposed date is 1120-1140,
but although it is doubtless to be associated with the
Knights Templars, the circumstances of its foundation are not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
known. The chancel is practically a modern reconstruction,
and an extensive restoration, which has been adversely criticized,
was applied by the Cambridge Camden Society to the whole
fabric in 1841. At several of the villages neighbouring or
suburban to Cambridge there are churches of interest, as at
Chesterton, Trumpington, Grantchester (where the name indicates
a Roman station, borne out by the discovery of remains),
Fen Ditton and Barnwell, near which is the Norman Sturbridge
chapel. In Cambridge itself there is a Norman house, much
altered, which by a tradition of unknown origin bears the name
of the School of Pythagoras.</p>

<p>The university is a corporate body, including all the colleges.
These, however, are also corporations in themselves, and have
their own statutes, but they are further subject to the
paramount laws of the university. The university
<span class="sidenote">University constitution and administration.</span>
statutes of Queen Elizabeth were only replaced in
1858. The statutes as revised by a commission in
that year were soon found to require emendation; in
1872 another commission was appointed, and in 1882 new
statutes received the approval of the queen in council. The
head of the university is the chancellor. He is a member of the
university, of high rank and position, elected by the senate.
Being generally non-resident, he delegates his administrative
duties to the vice-chancellor, who is the head of a college, and
is elected for one year by the senate. The principal executive
officers under the vice-chancellor are as follows. The two
proctors have as their main duty that of disciplinary officers
over the members of the university <i>in statu pupillari</i>. In each
year two colleges nominate one proctor each, according to a
fixed rotation which gives the larger colleges a more frequent
choice than the smaller. The proctors are assisted by four
pro-proctors. The public orator is the spokesman of the senate
upon such public occasions as the conferring of honorary
degrees. The librarian has charge of the university library.
The registrary, with his assistant, records the proceedings of
the senate, &amp;c., and has charge of documents. The university
returns two members to parliament, elected by the members of
the senate. The chancellor and <i>sex viri</i> (elected by the senate)
form a court for offences against the university statutes by
members not <i>in statu pupillari</i>. The chancellor and six heads of
colleges, appointed by the senate, form a court of discipline for
members <i>in statu pupillari</i>.</p>

<p>The senate in congregation is the legislative body. Those who
have votes in it are the chancellor, vice-chancellor, doctors of
divinity, law, medicine, science, letters and music,
and masters of art, law, surgery and music. The
<span class="sidenote">Senate.</span>
council of the senate, consisting of the chancellor, vice-chancellor,
four heads of colleges, four professors and eight other members
of the senate chosen by the vice-chancellor, brings all proposals
(called Graces) before the senate. The revenues of the university
are derived chiefly from fees at matriculation, for certain examinations,
and for degrees, from a tax upon all members of the
university, and from contributions by the colleges, together with
the profits of the University Press. A financial board, consisting
of the vice-chancellor <i>ex officio</i> and certain elected members,
administers the finances of the university. There are boards for
each of the various faculties, and a General Board of Studies,
with the vice-chancellor at the head. There are university
professors, readers or lecturers in a large number of subjects.
The oldest professorship is the Lady Margaret professorship of
divinity, instituted by the founders of Christ&rsquo;s and St John&rsquo;s
Colleges in 1502. In 1540 Henry VIII. founded the regius
professorships of divinity, civil law, physic, Hebrew and Greek.</p>

<p>The head of a college generally bears the title of master, as
indicated above in the account of the several colleges. It has
also seen that the foundation of each college
includes a certain number of fellows and scholars.
<span class="sidenote">College organization&mdash;undergraduates.</span>
The affairs of the college are managed by the head and
the fellows, or a committee of fellows. The scholars
and other members <i>in statu pupillari</i> are generally
termed collectively undergraduates. Those who receive no
emoluments (and therefore pay the full fees) are technically
called pensioners, and form the bulk of the undergraduates.
Another group of students receiving emoluments are termed
sizars; the primary object of sizarships is to open the university
course to men of limited means. The title of fellow-commoners
belongs to wealthy students who pay special fees and have the
right of dining at the fellows&rsquo; tables. This class has virtually
ceased to exist. As regards his work, the undergraduate in
college is under the intimate direction of his tutor; the disciplinary
officer in college is the dean. Besides the foundation
scholarships in each college there are generally certain scholarships
and exhibitions founded by private or special benefactions;
these are frequently awarded for the encouragement of specific
branches of study, or are confined wholly, or by preference, to
students from certain schools.</p>

<p>The total number of students is about 3000. The colleges
cannot accommodate this number, so that a student commonly
spends some part of his residence in lodgings, which
are licensed by, and under the control of, the university
<span class="sidenote">Residence and examinations.</span>
authorities. Such residence implies no sacrifice of
membership of a college. There are three terms&mdash;Michaelmas
(October), Lent and Easter (summer). They
include together not less than 227 days, though the actual period
of residence for undergraduates is about 24 weeks annually.
Undergraduates usually begin residence in Michaelmas term.
An elementary examination or other evidence of qualification is
required for admission to a college. After nine terms&rsquo; (three
years&rsquo;) residence an undergraduate can take the first degree, that
of bachelor of arts (B.A.). The examinations required for the
ordinary B.A. degree are&mdash;(1) Previous examination or Little-go
(usually taken in the first term of residence or at least in the first
year), including classics, mathematics and a gospel in Greek and
Paley&rsquo;s <i>Evidences of Christianity</i>, or an additional Greek or Latin
classic and logic. (2) General examination in classics and
mathematics, with a portion of English history, &amp;c. (3) Special
examination in a subject other than classical or mathematical.
Candidates for honours are required to pass the Previous examination
with certain additional subjects; they then have only a
&ldquo;tripos&rdquo; examination in one of the following subjects&mdash;mathematics,
classics, moral sciences, natural sciences, theology, law,
history, oriental languages, medieval and modern languages,
mechanical sciences, economics. The mathematical tripos is
divided into two parts, in the first of which, down to 1909, the
candidates were classed in the result as Wranglers, Senior
Optimes and Junior Optimes. There was also an individual
order of merit, the most proficient candidate being placed at the
head of the list as Senior Wrangler. But in 1906 a number of
important reforms of this tripos were proposed by the Mathematical
Board, and among these the abolition of the individual
order of merit was recommended and passed by the senate. It
is not employed in any other tripos. The classical tripos is also
in two parts, to the second of which certain kindred subjects are
added (ancient philosophy, history, &amp;c.). Individual order of
merit is not observed in either part, the candidates being grouped
in classes. There are a large number of university prizes and
scholarships on special foundations. Such are the Smith&rsquo;s prizes
for mathematics and natural philosophy, on the foundation
(1768) of Robert Smith, master of Trinity, awarded up to 1883
after examination, but since then for an essay on some branch of
each subject, and the Chancellor&rsquo;s medals, of which two have
been awarded annually in classics since the foundation of the
prizes in 1751 by Thomas Holles, duke of Newcastle.</p>

<p>The university may adopt as affiliated colleges institutions in
the United Kingdom or in any part of the British empire which
fulfil certain conditions as to the education of adult
students. Attendance at these institutions is counted as
<span class="sidenote">Affiliated colleges.</span>
equivalent to a certain period of residence at Cambridge
University in the event of a student wishing to pursue his work
here. There are over twenty such affiliated colleges. There are
also, in England, certain &ldquo;affiliated centres.&rdquo; These are towns
in which there is no affiliated college, but students who have
there attended a course of education managed in connexion
with the university by a committee may enter the university
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
with privileges similar to those enjoyed by students from
affiliated colleges.</p>

<p>The principal social function of the university is the &ldquo;May
Week&rdquo; at the close of the Easter term. It actually takes place
in June and lasts longer than a week. There is a great
influx of visitors into Cambridge for this occasion.
<span class="sidenote">May week.</span>
The first four days are occupied by the college boat-races on the
Cam, and on subsequent days there are college balls, concerts,
theatrical performances and other entertainments. On the
Tuesday after the races there is a Congregation, at which prize
exercises are recited, and usually, but not invariably, a number
of honorary degrees are conferred on eminent men by invitation.
This final period of the academic year is called Commencement,
or in Latin <i>Comitia Maxim</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMBRIDGE,<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Dorchester
county, Maryland, U.S.A., on the Choptank river, near Chesapeake
Bay, about 60 m. S.E. of Baltimore. Pop. (1890) 4192;
(1900) 5747 (1958 being negroes); (1910) 6407. It is served by the
Cambridge branch of the Philadelphia, Baltimore &amp; Washington
railway (Pennsylvania railway), which connects with the
main line at Seaford, 30 m. distant, and with the Baltimore,
Chesapeake &amp; Atlantic at Hurlock, 16 m. distant; and by
steamers of the Baltimore, Chesapeake &amp; Atlantic railway
company. It is a business centre for the prosperous farming
region by which it is surrounded, and is a shipping point for
oysters and fish; among its manufactures are canned fruits
and vegetables, flour, hominy, phosphates, underwear and
lumber. Cambridge was founded in 1684, received its present
name in 1686, and was chartered as a city in 1900.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMBRIDGE,<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> a city and one of the county-seats of Middlesex
county, Massachusetts, U.S.A., situated on the Charles river,
in the outskirts of Boston, of which it is in effect a part, although
under separate government. Pop. (1880) 52,669; (1890)
70,028; (1900) 91,886; (1910 census) 104,839. Of the
total population in 1900, 30,446 were foreign-born, including
11,235 Irish, 9613 English Canadians, 1944 English, 1483 French
Canadians and 1584 Swedish; and 54,200 were of foreign
parentage (both parents foreign-born), including 24,961 of Irish
parentage, 9829 of English-Canadian parentage, 2587 of English
parentage, and 2288 of French-Canadian parentage. Cambridge
is entered directly by only one railway, the Boston &amp; Maine.
The township, now practically built over by the city, contained
originally several separate villages, the names of which are still
used as a convenience in designating corresponding sections of
the municipality: Old Cambridge, North Cambridge, Cambridgeport
and East Cambridge, the last two being manufacturing
and commercial districts.</p>

<p>Old Cambridge is noted as the seat of Harvard University
(<i>q.v.</i>) and as a literary and scientific centre. Radcliffe College
(1879), for women, practically a part of Harvard; an Episcopal
Theological School (1867), and the New Church (Swedenborgian
or New Jerusalem) Theological School (1866) are other educational
institutions of importance. To Cambridge also, in 1908,
was removed Andover Theological Seminary, a Congregational
institution chartered in 1807, opened in Andover, Massachusetts,
in 1808 (re-incorporated under separate trustees in 1907). This
seminary is one of the oldest and most famous theological institutions
in the United States; it grew out of the theological teaching
previously given in Phillips Academy, and was founded by the
widow of Lt.-Governor Samuel Phillips, her son John Phillips
and Samuel Abbot (1732-1812). The instruction was strongly
Calvinistic in the earlier period, but the seminary has always
been &ldquo;equally open to Protestants of every denomination.&rdquo;
Very liberal aid is given to students, and there is no charge for
tuition. The <i>Bibliotheca Sacra</i>, founded in 1843 by Edward
Robinson and in 1844 taken over by Professors Bela B. Edwards
and Edwards A. Park, and the <i>Andover Review</i> (1884-1893), have
been the organs of the seminary. In 1886 some of its professors
published <i>Progressive Orthodoxy</i>, a book which made a great stir
by its liberal tone, its opposition to supernaturalism and its
evident trend toward the methods of German &ldquo;higher criticism.&rdquo;
Legal proceedings for the removal of five professors, after the
publication of this book, failed; and their successful defence
helped to secure greater freedom in thought and in instruction
in American Presbyterian and Congregational theological
seminaries. The seminary is now affiliated with Harvard
University, though it remains independent and autonomous.</p>

<p>Cambridge is a typical New England city, built up in detached
residences, with irregular streets pleasantly shaded, and a
considerable wealth of historic and literary associations. There
are many reminders of the long history of Harvard, and of the
War of Independence. Cambridge was the site of the camp of
the first American army, at the outbreak of the war, and from
it went the detachment which intrenched on Bunker&rsquo;s Hill.
Here are the Apthorp House (built in 1760), in which General
Burgoyne and his officers were lodged as prisoners of war in
1777; the elm under which, according to tradition, Washington
took command of the Continental Army on the 3rd of July 1775;
the old Vassall or Craigie House (1759), where Washington lived
in 1775-1776, and which was later the home of Edward Everett,
Joseph E. Worcester, Jared Sparks and (1837-1882) Henry W.
Longfellow. Elbridge Gerry lived and James Russell Lowell
was born, lived and died in &ldquo;Elmwood&rdquo; (built in 1767); Oliver
Wendell Holmes was born in Cambridge also; John Fiske, the
historian, lived here; and there are many other literary associations,
attractive and important for those interested in American
letters. In Mt Auburn Cemetery are buried many artists, poets,
scholars and other men and women of fame. Cambridge is
one of the few American cities possessing a crematorium (1900).
The municipal water-works are excellent. A handsome bridge
joining Cambridgeport to Boston (cost about $2,250,000) was
opened late in 1906. Four other bridges span the Charles river
between the two cities. A dam between East Cambridge and
Boston, traversed by a roadway 150 ft. wide, was in the process
of construction in 1907; and an extension of the Boston subway
into Cambridge to the grounds of Harvard University, a distance
of about 3 m., was projected. The city government is administered
almost entirely under the state civil-service laws, Cambridge
having been a leader in the adoption of its provisions.
A non-partisan association for political reform did excellent
work from 1890 to 1900, when it was superseded by a non-partisan
party. Since 1887 the city has declared yearly by
increasing majorities for prohibition of the liquor traffic. The
high schools enjoy a notable reputation. A handsome city hall
(cost $235,000) and public library (as well as a manual training
school) were given to the city by Frederick H. Rindge, a one-time
resident, whose benefactions to Cambridge aggregated
in value $650,000. Cambridge has many manufacturing establishments,
and in 1905 the city&rsquo;s factory products were valued
at $42,407,064, an increase of 45.8% over their value in 1900.
The principal manufactures are slaughtering and meat-packing
products, foundry and machine-shop products, rubber boots and
shoes, rubber belting and hose, printing and publishing products,
carpentering, pianos and organs, confectionery and furniture.
Cambridge is one of the chief publishing centres of the country.
The tax valuation of property in 1906 ($105,153,235) was more
than $1000 per inhabitant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span></p>

<p>Cambridge is &ldquo;one of the few American towns that may be
said to have owed their very name and existence to the pursuit
of letters&rdquo; (T.W. Higginson). Its site was selected in 1630
by Governor Winthrop and others as suitable for fortifications
and defence, and it was intended to make it the capital of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony; but as Boston&rsquo;s peninsular position
gave it the advantage in commerce and in defence against the
Indians, the plan fell through, although up to 1638 various
sessions of the general court and particular courts were held
here. The township records (published) are continuous since
1632. A direct tax for the wooden &ldquo;pallysadoe&rdquo; about Cambridge
led the township of Watertown in 1632 to make the first
protest in America against taxation without representation.
The settlement was first known as the &ldquo;New Towne,&rdquo; but in
1638 was named Cambridge in honour of the English Cambridge,
where several score of the first immigrants to the colony were
educated. The oldest college in America (Harvard) was founded
here in 1636. In 1639 there was set up in Cambridge the first
printing press of British North America (Boston having none
until 1676). Other notable dates in history are 1637 and 1647,
when general synods of New England churches met at Cambridge
to settle disputed doctrine and define orthodoxy; the departure
for Connecticut of Thomas Hooker&rsquo;s congregation in 1636; the
meeting of the convention that framed the present constitution
of the commonwealth, 1779-1780; the separation of the
Congregationalists and Unitarians of the first parish church, in 1829;
and the grant of a city charter in 1846. The original township
of Cambridge was very large, and there have been successively
detached from it, Newton (1691), Lexington (1713), Brighton
(1837) and Arlington (1867).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMBRIDGE,<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Guernsey county,
Ohio, U.S.A., on Wills Creek, about 75 m. E. by N. of Columbus.
Pop. (1890) 4361; (1900) 8241, of whom 407 were foreign-born;
(1910 census) 11,327. It is served by the Baltimore &amp;
Ohio and the Pennsylvania railways, and is connected by an
electric line with Byesville (pop. in 1910, 3156), about 7 m. S.
Cambridge is built on a hill about 800 ft. above sea-level.
There is a public library. Coal, oil, natural gas, clay and iron
are found in the vicinity, and among the city&rsquo;s manufactures are
iron, steel, glass, furniture and pottery. The value of its
factory products in 1905 was $2,440,917. The municipality
owns and operates the water-works. Cambridge was first settled
in 1798 by emigrants from the island of Guernsey (whence the
name of the county); was laid out as a town in 1806; was
incorporated as a village in 1837; and was chartered as a city
in 1893.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMBRIDGE PLATONISTS,<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> a school of philosophico-religious
thinkers which flourished mainly at Cambridge University in the
second half of the 17th century. The founder was Benjamin
Whichcote and the chief members were Ralph Cudworth,
Richard Cumberland, Joseph Glanvill, Henry More and John
Norris (see separate articles). Other less important members
were Nathanael Culverwel (d. 1651?), Theophilus Gale (1628-1678),
John Pordage (1607-1681), George Rust (d. 1670), John
Smith (1618-1652) and John Worthington (1618-1671). They
represented liberal thought at the time and were generally
known as Latitudinarians. Their views were due to a reaction
against three main tendencies in contemporary English thought:
the sacerdotalism of Laud and his followers, the obscurantist
sectaries and, most important of all, the doctrines of Hobbes.
They consist chiefly of a reconciliation between reason and
religion, resulting in a generally tolerant spirit. They tend
always to mysticism and the contemplation of things transcendental.
In spite of inaccuracy and the lack of critical capacity
in dealing with their authorities both ancient and modern, the
Cambridge Platonists exercised a valuable influence on English
theology and thought in general. Their chief contributions to
thought were Cudworth&rsquo;s theory of the &ldquo;plastic nature&rdquo; of
God, More&rsquo;s elaborate mysticism, Norris&rsquo;s appreciation of Malebranche,
Glanvill&rsquo;s conception of scepticism as an aid to Faith,
and, in a less degree, the harmony of Faith and Reason elaborated
by Culverwel. The one doctrine on which they all combined to
lay especial emphasis was the absolute existence of right and
wrong quite apart from the theory of divine authority. Their
chief authorities were Plato and the Neo-platonists (between
whom they made no adequate distinction), and among modern
philosophers, Descartes, Malebranche and Boehme. From these
sources they attempted to evolve a philosophy of religion,
which would not only refute the views of Hobbes, but would
also free theology finally from the errors of scholasticism,
without plunging it in the newer dangers of unfettered rationalism
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ethics</a></span>).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMBRIDGESHIRE,<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> an eastern county of England, bounded
N. by Lincolnshire, E. by Norfolk and Suffolk, S. by Essex and
Hertfordshire, and W. by Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire and
Northamptonshire. The area is 858.9 sq. m. The greater part
of the county falls within the district of the Fens, and is flat,
elevated only a few feet above sea-level, and intersected with
innumerable drainage channels. The physical characteristics of
this district, and the history of its reclamation from a marshy
and in great part uninhabitable condition, fall for consideration
under the heading FENS. Except in the south of the county the
scenery of the flat land is hardly ever varied by rising ground or
wood, and owes the attraction it possesses rather to individuality
than to beauty. At the south-eastern and southern boundaries,
and to the west of Cambridge, bordering the valley of the Cam on
the north, the land rises in gentle undulations; but for the rest,
such elevations as the Gog Magog Hills, S.E. of Cambridge, and
the gentle hillock on which the city of Ely stands, are isolated
and conspicuous from afar. The principal rivers are the Ouse
and its tributaries in the south and centre, and the Nene
in the north; the greater part of the waters of both these
rivers within Cambridgeshire flow in artificial channels, of
which those for the Ouse, two great parallel cuts between
Earith and Denver Sluice, in Norfolk, called the Bedford
Rivers, form the most remarkable feature in the drainage of
the county. The old main channel of the Ouse, from Ely
downward to Denver (below which are tidal waters), is filled
chiefly by the waters of the Cam or Granta, which joins the
Ouse 3 m. above Ely, the Lark (which with its feeder, the
Kennett, forms the boundary of the county with Suffolk for a
considerable distance) and the Little Ouse, forming part of the
boundary with Norfolk.</p>

<p><i>Geology</i>.&mdash;By its geological features, Cambridgeshire is
divisible into three well-marked regions; in the south and
south-east are the low uplands formed by the Chalk; north of
this, but best developed in the south-west, is a clay and greensand
area; all the remaining portion is alluvial Fenland. The general
strike of the rocks is along a south-west and north-east line, the
dip is south-easterly. The oldest rock is the Jurassic Oxford
Clay, which appears as an irregular strip of elevated flat ground
reaching from Croxton by Conington and Fenny Drayton to
Willingham and Rampton. Eastward and northward it no doubt
forms the floor of the Fen country, and at Thorney and Whittlesea
small patches rise like islands, through the level fen alluvium.
The Coralline Oolite, with the Els worth or St Ives rock at the
base, occurs as a small patch, covered by Greensand, at Upware,
whence many fossils have been obtained; elsewhere its place is
taken by the Ampthill Clays, which are passage beds between the
Oxford and Kimmeridge Clays. The latter clay lies in a narrow
strip by Papworth St Agnes, Oakington and Cottenham; a
large irregular outcrop surrounds Haddenham and Ely, and
similar occurrences are at March, Chatteris and Manea. Above
the Kimmeridge Clay comes the Lower Greensand, sandy for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
greater part, but here and there hardened into the condition
known as &ldquo;Carstone,&rdquo; which has been used as an inferior
building-stone. This formation is thickest in the south-west; it
extends from the border by Gamlingay, Cuxton and Cottenham,
and appears again in outliers at Upware, Ely and Haddenham.
The Gault forms a strip of flat ground, 4 to 6 m. wide, running
roughly parallel with the course of the river Cam, from Guilden
Morden through Cambridge to Soham; it is a stiff blue clay
200 ft. thick in the south-west, but is thinner eastward. At the
bottom of the chalk is the Chalk Marl, 10 to 20 ft. thick, with
a glauconitic and phosphatic nodule-bearing layer at its base,
known as the Cambridge Greensand. This bed has been largely
worked for the nodules and for cement; it contains many
fossils derived from the Gault below. Several outliers of Chalk
Marl lie upon the Gault west of the Cam. The Chalk comprises
all the main divisions of the formation, including the Totternhoe
stone, Melbourn rock and Chalk rock. Much glacial boulder
clay covers all the higher ground of the county; it is a stiff
brownish clay with many chalk fragments of travelled rocks.
Near Ely there is a remarkable mass of chalk, evidently transported
by ice, resting on and surrounded by boulder clay.
Plateau gravel caps some of the chalk hills, and old river gravels
occur at lower levels with the bones of mammoth, rhinoceros and
other extinct mammals. The low-lying Fen beds are marly silt
with abundant peat beds and buried forests; at the bottom is a
gravel layer of marine origin.</p>

<p><i>Industries</i>.&mdash;The climate is as a whole healthy, the fens being
so carefully drained that diseases to which dwellers in marshy
districts are commonly liable are practically eliminated. The
land is very fertile, and although some decrease is generally
apparent in the acreage under grain crops, Cambridgeshire is
one of the principal grain-producing counties in England.
Nearly nine-tenths of the total area is under cultivation, and an
unusually small proportion is under permanent pasture. Wheat
is the chief grain crop, but large quantities of barley and oats are
also grown. Among green crops potatoes occupy a large and
increasing area. Dairy-farming is especially practised in the
south-west, where the district of the Cam valley has long been
known as the Dairies; and much butter and cheese are sent to
the London markets. Sheep are pastured extensively on the
higher ground, but the number of these and of cattle for the
county as a whole is not large. Beans occupy a considerable
acreage, and fruit-growing and market-gardening are important
in many parts. There is no large manufacturing industry
common to the county in general; among minor trades brewing
is carried on at several places, and brick-making and lime-burning
may also be mentioned.</p>

<p><i>Communications</i>.&mdash;The principal railway serving the county is
the Great Eastern, of which system numerous branch lines centre
chiefly upon Cambridge, Ely and March. Cambridge is also
served by branches of the Great Northern line from Hitchin,
of the London &amp; North-Western from Bletchley and Bedford,
and of the Midland from Kettering. A trunk line connecting
the eastern counties with the north and north-west of England
runs northward from March under the joint working of the Great
Northern and Great Eastern companies. The artificial waterways
provide the county with an extensive system of inland
navigation; and a considerable proportion of the industrial
population is employed on these. In this connexion the building
of boats and barges is carried on at several towns.</p>

<p><i>Population and Administration</i>.&mdash;The area of the ancient
county is 549,723 acres, with a population in 1891 of 188,961,
and in 1901 of 190,682. The ancient county includes the two
administrative counties of Cambridge in the south and the Isle
of Ely in the north. The liberty of the Isle of Ely was formerly
of the independent nature of a county palatine, but ceased to
be so under acts of 1836 and 1837. Its area is 238,048 acres,
and that of the administrative county of Cambridge 315,171
acres. Cambridgeshire contains seventeen hundreds. The
municipal boroughs are Cambridge, the county town (pop.
38,379), in the administrative county of Cambridge, and Wisbech
(9381) in the Isle of Ely. The other urban districts are&mdash;in the
administrative county of Cambridge, Chesterton (9591), and in
the Isle of Ely, Chatteris (4711), Ely (7713), March (7565) and
Whittlesey (3909). Among other considerable towns Soham
(4230) and Littleport (4181), both in the neighbourhood of Ely,
may be mentioned. The town of Newmarket, which, although
wholly within the administrative county of West Suffolk, is
mainly in the ancient county of Cambridgeshire, is famous for
its race-meetings. The county is in the south-eastern circuit,
and assizes are held at Cambridge. Each administrative county
has a court of quarter sessions, and the two are divided into ten
petty sessional divisions. The borough of Cambridge has a
separate court of quarter sessions, and this borough and Wisbech
have separate commissions of the peace. The university of
Cambridge exercises disciplinary jurisdiction over its members.
There are 168 entire civil parishes in the two administrative
counties. Cambridgeshire is almost wholly in the diocese of Ely
and the archdeaconries of Ely and Sudbury, but small portions
are within the dioceses of St Albans and Norwich. There are
194 ecclesiastical parishes or districts wholly or in part within
the county. The parliamentary divisions are three, namely,
Northern or Wisbech, Western or Chesterton, and Eastern or
Newmarket, each returning one member. The county also
contains the parliamentary borough of Cambridge, returning
one member; and the university of Cambridge returns two
members.</p>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The earliest English settlements in what is now
Cambridgeshire were made about the 6th century by bands of
Engles, who pushed their way up the Ouse and the Cam, and
established themselves in the fen-district, where they became
known as the Gyrwas, the districts corresponding to the modern
counties of Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire being distinguished
as the lands of the North Gyrwas and the South
Gyrwas respectively. At this period the fen-district stretched
southward as far as Cambridge, and the essential unity which
it preserved is illustrated later by its inclusion under one
sheriff, chosen in successive years from Cambridgeshire proper,
the Isle of Ely and Huntingdonshire. In 656 numerous lands in
the neighbourhood of Wisbech were included in the endowment
of the abbey of Peterborough, and in the same century religious
houses were established at Ely and Thorney, both of which,
however, were destroyed during the Danish invasions of the
9th century. After the treaty of Wedmore the district became
part of the Danelaw. On the expulsion of the Danes by Edward
in the 10th century it was included in East Anglia, but in the
11th century was again overrun by the Danes, who in the course
of their devastations burnt Cambridge. The first mention of
the shire in the Saxon Chronicle records the valiant resistance
which it opposed to the invaders in 1010 when the rest of East
Anglia had taken ignominious flight. The shire-system of
East Anglia was in all probability not definitely settled before
the Conquest, but during the Danish occupation of the 9th century
the district possessed a certain military and political organization
round Cambridge, its chief town, whence probably originated
the constitution and demarcation of the later shire. At the time
of the Domesday Survey the county was divided as now, except
that the Isle of Ely, which then formed two hundreds having
their meeting-place at Witchford, is now divided into the four
hundreds of Ely, Wisbech, North Witchford and South Witchford,
while Cambridge formed a hundred by itself. The
hundred of Flendish was then known as Flamingdike. Cambridgeshire
was formerly included in the diocese of Lincoln,
until, on the erection of Ely to a bishop&rsquo;s see in 1109, almost the
whole county was placed in that diocese. In 1291 the whole
county, with the exception of parishes in the deanery of Fordham
and diocese of Norwich, constituted the archdeaconry of Ely,
comprising the deaneries of Ely, Wisbech, Chesterton, Cambridge,
Shingay, Bourn, Barton and Camps. The Isle of Ely formerly
constituted an independent franchise in which the bishops
exercised quasi-palatinate rights, and offences were held to be
committed against the bishop&rsquo;s peace. These privileges were
considerably abridged in the reign of Henry VIII., but the Isle
still had separate civil officers, appointed by the bishop, chief

among whom were the chief justice, chief bailiff, deputy bailiff
and two coroners. The bishop is still <i>custos rotulorum</i> of the
Isle. Cambridgeshire has always been remarkable for its lack
of county families, and for the frequent changes in the ownership
of estates. No Englishmen retained lands of any importance
after the Conquest, and at the time of the Domesday Survey
the chief lay proprietors were Alan, earl of Brittany, whose
descendants the Zouches retained estates in the county until
the 15th century; Picot the sheriff, whose estates passed to
the families of Peverell and Peche; Aubrey de Vere, whose
descendants retained their estates till the 16th century; and
Hardwinus de Scalariis, ancestor of the Scales of Whaddon.</p>

<p>From the time of Hereward&rsquo;s famous resistance to the Conqueror
in the fen-district, the Isle of Ely was intimately concerned
with the great political struggles of the country. It was defended
against Stephen by Bishop Nigellus of Ely, who fortified Ely
and Aldreth, and the latter in 1144 was held for the empress
Maud by Geoffrey de Mandeville. During the struggles between
John and his barons, Faukes de Breaut√© was made governor of
Cambridge Castle, which, however, surrendered to the barons
in the same year. The Isle of Ely was seized by the followers
of Simon de Montfort in 1266, but in 1267 was taken by Prince
Edward. At the Reformation period the county showed much
sympathy with the Reformers, and in 1642 the knights, gentry
and commoners of Cambridgeshire petitioned for the removal
of all unwarrantable orders and dignities, and the banishment
of popish clergy. In the civil war of the 17th century
Cambridgeshire was one of the associated counties in which the
king had no visible party, though the university assisted him
with contributions of plate and money.</p>

<p>Cambridgeshire has always been mainly an agricultural
county. The Domesday Survey mentions over ninety mills
and numerous valuable fisheries, especially eel-fisheries, and
contains frequent references to wheat, malt and honey. The
county had a flourishing wool-industry in the 14th century,
and became noted for its worsted cloths. The Black Death of
1349 and the ravages committed during the Wars of the Roses
were followed by periods of severe depression, and in 1439 several
Cambridgeshire towns obtained a remission of taxation on the
plea of poverty. In the 16th century barley for malt was grown
in large quantities in the south, and the manufacture of willow-baskets
was carried on in the fen-districts. Saffron was extensively
cultivated in the 18th century, and paper was manufactured
near Sturbridge. Sturbridge fair was at this period reckoned
the largest in Europe, the chief articles of merchandise being
wool, hops and leather; and the Newmarket races and horse-trade
were already famous. Large waste areas were brought
under cultivation in the 17th century through the drainage
of the fen-district, which was brought to completion about
1652 through the labours of Cornelius Vermuyden, a Dutchman.
The coprolite industry was very profitable for a short period
from 1850 to 1880, and its decline was accompanied by a general
industrial and agricultural depression. Cambridgeshire returned
three members to parliament in 1290, and in 1295 the county
returned two members, the borough of Cambridge two members,
and the city of Ely two members, this being the sole return for
Ely. The university was summoned to return members in 1300
and again in 1603, but no returns are recorded before 1614,
after which it continued to return two members. Under the
Reform Act of 1832 the county returned three members.</p>

<p><i>Antiquities</i>.&mdash;In ecclesiastical architecture Cambridgeshire
would be rich only in the possession of the magnificent cathedral
at Ely and the round church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jesus
College and King&rsquo;s College chapels, and many other examples
in Cambridge. But there are many fine churches elsewhere.
At Thorney, a small town in the north of the county, which owes
much in appearance to the 8th duke of Bedford (d. 1872), the
parish church is actually a portion of the church of an abbey
said to date originally from the 7th century, and refounded in
972 by Ethelwold, bishop of Winchester, as a Benedictine
monastery. The church is partly fine Norman. Another
Norman building of special interest is Sturbridge chapel near
Cambridge, which belonged to a lepers&rsquo; hospital. To this
foundation King John granted a fair, which became, and continued
until the 18th century, one of the most important in England. It
is still held in September. At Swaffham Prior there are remains
of two churches in one churchyard, the tower of one being good
Transitional Norman, while that of the other is Perpendicular,
the upper part octagonal. Among many Early English examples
the church of Cherry Hinton near Cambridge may be mentioned.
The churches of Trumpington and Bottisham are fine specimens
of the Decorated style; in the first is a famous brass to Sir
Roger de Trumpington (1289). As Perpendicular examples the
tower and spire of St Mary&rsquo;s, Whittlesey, and the rich wooden
roof of Outwell church, may be selected. Monastic remains
are scanty. Excluding the town of Cambridge there are no
domestic buildings, either ancient or modern, of special note,
with the exception of Sawston Hall, in the south of the county,
a quadrangular mansion dated 1557-1584.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMBYSES<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> (Pers. <i>Kambujiya</i>), the name borne by the father
and the son of Cyrus the Great. When Cyrus conquered Babylon
in 539 he was employed in leading religious ceremonies (<i>Chronicle
of Nabonidus</i>), and in the cylinder which contains Cyrus&rsquo;s
proclamation to the Babylonians his name is joined to that of
his father in the prayers to Marduk. On a tablet dated from the
first year of Cyrus, Cambyses is called king of Babel. But his
authority seems to have been quite ephemeral; it was only in
530, when Cyrus set out on his last expedition into the East,
that he associated Cambyses on the throne, and numerous
Babylonian tablets of this time are dated from the accession
and the first year of Cambyses, when Cyrus was &ldquo;king of the
countries&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> of the world). After the death of his father in
the spring of 528 Cambyses became sole king. The tablets dated
from his reign in Babylonia go down to the end of his eighth
year, <i>i.e.</i> March 521 <span class="sc">b.c.</span><a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Herodotus (iii. 66), who dates his reign
from the death of Cyrus, gives him seven years five months, <i>i.e.</i>
from 528 to the summer of 521. For these dates cf. Ed. Meyer,
<i>Forschungen zur alien Geschichte</i>, ii. 470 ff.</p>

<p>The traditions about Cambyses, preserved by the Greek
authors, come from two different sources. The first, which
forms the main part of the account of Herodotus (iii. 2; 4;
10-37), is of Egyptian origin. Here Cambyses is made the
legitimate son of Cyrus and a daughter of Apries (Herod, iii. 2,
Dinon fr. 11, Polyaen. viii. 29), whose death he avenges on the
successor of the usurper Amasis. (In Herod, iii. 1 and Ctesias
<i>ap</i>. Athen. xiii. 560 D, this tradition is corrected by the Persians:
Cambyses wants to marry a daughter of Amasis, who sends
him a daughter of Apries instead of his own daughter, and by
her Cambyses is induced to begin the war.) His great crime is
the killing of the Apis, for which he is punished by madness,
in which he commits many other crimes, kills his brother and his
sister, and at last loses his empire and dies from a wound in the hip,
at the same place where he had wounded the sacred animal.
Intermingled are some stories derived from the Greek mercenaries,
especially about their leader Phanes of Halicarnassus, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
betrayed Egypt to the Persians. In the Persian tradition the
crime of Cambyses is the murder of his brother; he is further
accused of drunkenness, in which he commits many crimes, and
thus accelerates his ruin. These traditions are found in different
passages of Herodotus, and in a later form, but with some
trustworthy detail about his household, in the fragments of
Ctesias. With the exception of Babylonian dated tablets and
some Egyptian inscriptions, we possess no contemporary evidence
about the reign of Cambyses but the short account of Darius in
the Behistun inscription. It is impossible from these sources to
form a correct picture of Cambyses&rsquo; character; but it seems
certain that he was a wild despot and that he was led by
drunkenness to many atrocious deeds.</p>

<p>It was quite natural that, after Cyrus had conquered Asia,
Cambyses should undertake the conquest of Egypt, the only
remaining independent state of the Eastern world. Before he
set out on his expedition he killed his brother Bardiya (Smerdis),
whom Cyrus had appointed governor of the eastern provinces.
The date is given by Darius, whereas the Greek authors narrate
the murder after the conquest of Egypt. The war took place in
525, when Amasis had just been succeeded by his son Psammetichus
III. Cambyses had prepared for the march through
the desert by an alliance with Arabian chieftains, who brought a
large supply of water to the stations. King Amasis had hoped
that Egypt would be able to withstand the threatened Persian
attack by an alliance with the Greeks. But this hope failed;
the Cyprian towns and the tyrant Polycrates of Samos, who
possessed a large fleet, now preferred to join the Persians, and
the commander of the Greek troops, Phanes of Halicarnassus,
went over to them. In the decisive battle at Pelusium the
Egyptians were beaten, and shortly afterwards Memphis was
taken. The captive king Psammetichus was executed, having
attempted a rebellion. The Egyptian inscriptions show that
Cambyses officially adopted the titles and the costume of the
Pharaohs, although we may very well believe that he did not
conceal his contempt for the customs and the religion of the
Egyptians. From Egypt Cambyses attempted the conquest of
Ethiopia (Cush), <i>i.e.</i> the kingdom of Napata and Meroe, the
modern Nubia. But his army was not able to cross the deserts;
after heavy losses he was forced to return. In an inscription
from Napata (in the Berlin museum) the Ethiopian king Nastesen
relates that he had beaten the troops of Kembasuden, <i>i.e.</i>
Cambyses, and taken all his ships (H. Sch√§fer, <i>Die Aethiopische
K√∂nigsinschrift des Berliner Museums</i>, 1901). Another expedition
against the great oasis failed likewise, and the plan of attacking
Carthage was frustrated by the refusal of the Phoenicians
to operate against their kindred. Meanwhile in Persia a usurper,
the Magian Gaumata, arose in the spring of 522, who pretended
to be the murdered Bardiya (Smerdis). He was acknowledged
throughout Asia. Cambyses attempted to march against him,
but, seeing probably that success was impossible, died by his
own hand (March 521). This is the account of Darius, which
certainly must be preferred to the traditions of Herodotus and
Ctesias, which ascribe his death to an accident. According to
Herodotus (iii. 64) he died in the Syrian Ecbatana, <i>i.e.</i> Hamath;
Josephus (<i>Ant.</i> xi. 2. 2) names Damascus; Ctesias, Babylon,
which is absolutely impossible.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMDEN, CHARLES PRATT,<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Earl</span> (1714-1794), lord
chancellor of England, was born in Kensington in 1714. He was
a descendant of an old Devonshire family of high standing, the
third son of Sir John Pratt, chief-justice of the king&rsquo;s bench in
the reign of George I. He received his early education at Eton
and King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge. In 1734 he became a fellow of
his college, and in the following year obtained his degree of B.A.
Having adopted his father&rsquo;s profession, he had entered the
Middle Temple in 1728, and ten years later he was called to the
bar. He practised at first in the courts of common law, travelling
also the western circuit. For some years his practice was so
limited, and he became so much discouraged, that he seriously
thought of turning his back on the law and entering the church.
He listened, however, to the advice of his friend Sir Robert
Henley, a brother barrister, afterwards known as Lord Chancellor
Northington, and persevered, working on and waiting for success.
The first case which brought him prominently into notice and
gave him assurance of ultimate success was the government
prosecution, in 1752, of a bookseller, William Owen, for a libel on
the House of Commons.</p>

<p>His speech for the defence contributed much to the verdict for
the defendant. In 1757, through the influence of William Pitt
(afterwards earl of Chatham), with whom he had formed an
intimate friendship while at Eton, he received the appointment
of attorney-general. The same year he entered the House of
Commons as member for the borough of Downton in Wiltshire.
He sat in parliament four years, but did not distinguish himself
as a debater. His professional practice now largely increased.
One of the most noticeable incidents of his tenure of office as
attorney-general was the prosecution of Dr. J. Shebbeare (1709-1788),
a violent party writer of the day, for a libel against the
government contained in his notorious <i>Letters to the People of
England</i>, which were published in the years 1756-1758. As a
proof of Pratt&rsquo;s moderation in a period of passionate party
warfare and frequent state trials, it is noted that this was the
only official prosecution for libel which he set on foot. In
January 1762 Pratt was raised to the bench as chief-justice of the
common pleas. He was at the same time knighted. Soon after
his elevation the nation was thrown into great excitement about
the prosecution of John Wilkes, and the question involved in it
of the legality of &ldquo;general warrants.&rdquo; Chief-Justice Pratt
pronounced, with decisive and almost passionate energy, against
their legality, thus giving voice to the strong feeling of the nation
and winning for himself an extraordinary degree of popularity
as one of the &ldquo;maintainers of English constitutional liberty.&rdquo;
Honours fell thick upon him in the form of addresses from the city
of London and many large towns, and of presentations of freedom
from various corporate bodies. In July 1765 he was raised to
the peerage as Baron Camden, of Camden Place, in the county of
Kent; and in the following year he was removed from the court
of common pleas to take his seat as lord chancellor (July 30,
1766). This seat he retained less than four years; for although
he discharged its duties in so efficient a manner that, with one
exception, his decisions were never reversed on appeal, he took
up a position of such uncompromising hostility to the governments
of the day, the Grafton and North administrations, on
the greatest and most exciting matters, the treatment of the
American colonies and the proceedings against John Wilkes,
that the government had no choice but to require of him the
surrender of the great seal. He retired from the court of chancery
in January 1770, but he continued to take a warm interest in
the political affairs and discussions of the time. He continued
steadfastly to oppose the taxation of the American colonists, and
signed, in 1778, the protest of the Lords in favour of an address
to the king on the subject of the manifesto of the commissioners
to America. In 1782 he was appointed president of the
council under the Rockingham administration, but retired in the
following year. Within a few months he was reinstated in this
office under the Pitt administration, and held it till his death.
Lord Camden was a strenuous opponent of Fox&rsquo;s India Bill, took
an animated part in the debates on important public matters
till within two years of his death, introduced in 1786 the scheme
of a regency on occasion of the king&rsquo;s insanity, and to the last
zealously defended his early views on the functions of juries,
especially of their right to decide on all questions of libel. He
was raised to the dignity of an earl in May 1786, and was at the
same time created Viscount Bayham. Earl Camden died in
London on the 18th of April 1794. His remains were interred in
Seale church in Kent.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMDEN, JOHN JEFFREYS PRATT,<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> <span class="sc">2nd Earl</span> and <span class="sc">1st
Marquess</span> (1759-1840), only son of the 1st earl, was born on the
11th of February 1750, and was educated at Trinity College,
Cambridge. In 1780 he was chosen member of parliament for
Bath, and he obtained the lucrative position of teller of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
exchequer, an office which he kept until his death, although
after 1812 he refused to receive the large income arising from it.
In the ministry of William Pitt, Pratt was successively a lord of
the admiralty and a lord of the treasury; then, having succeeded
his father in the earldom in 1794, he was appointed lord-lieutenant
of Ireland in 1795. Disliked in Ireland as an opponent
of Roman Catholic emancipation and as the exponent of an
unpopular policy, Camden&rsquo;s term of office was one of commotion
and alarm, culminating in the rebellion of 1798. Immediately
after the suppression of the rising he resigned, and in 1804
became secretary for war and the colonies under Pitt, and in
1805 lord president of the council. He was again lord president
from 1807 to 1812, after which date he remained for some
time in the cabinet without office. In 1812 he was created
earl of Brecknock and Marquess Camden. He died on the 8th
of October 1840, and was succeeded by his only son, George
Charles, 2nd marquess (1799-1866). The present marquess is
his descendant. Camden was chancellor of the university of
Cambridge and a knight of the Garter.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMDEN, WILLIAM<a name="ar101" id="ar101"></a></span> (1551-1623), English antiquary and
historian, was born in London on the 2nd of May 1551. His
father, Sampson Camden, a native of Lichfield, had settled in
London, and, as a painter, had become a member of the company
of painter-stainers. His mother, Elizabeth, belonged to the old
Cumberland family of Curwen. Young Camden received his
early education at Christ&rsquo;s Hospital and St Paul&rsquo;s school, and
in 1566 went to Magdalen College, Oxford, probably as a servitor
or chorister. Failing to obtain a demyship at Magdalen he removed
to Broadgates Hall, afterwards Pembroke College, and
later to Christ Church, where he was supported by his friend,
Dr Thomas Thornton, canon of Christ Church. As a defender
of the established religion he was soon engaged in controversy,
and his failure to secure a fellowship at All Souls&rsquo; College is
attributed to the hostility of the Roman Catholics. In 1570
he supplicated in vain for the degree of B.A., and although a
renewed application was granted in 1573 it is doubtful if he ever
took a degree; and in 1571 he went to London and devoted
himself to antiquarian studies, for which he had already acquired
a taste.</p>

<p>Camden spent some time in travelling in various parts of
England collecting materials for his <i>Britannia</i>, a work which
was first published in 1586. Owing to his friendship with Dr
Gabriel Goodman, dean of Westminster, Camden was made
second master of Westminster school in 1575; and when Dr
Edward Grant resigned the headmastership in 1593 he was
appointed as his successor. The vacations which he enjoyed
as a schoolmaster left him time for study and travel, and during
these years he supervised the publication of three further
editions of the <i>Britannia</i>. Although a layman he was granted
the prebend of Ilfracombe in 1589, and in 1597 he resigned his
position at Westminster on being made Clarencieux king-at-arms,
an appointment which caused some ill-feeling, and the York
herald, Ralph Brooke, led an attack on the genealogical accuracy
of the <i>Britannia</i>, and accused its author of plagiarism. Camden
replied to Brooke in an appendix to the fifth edition of the
<i>Britannia</i>, published in 1600, and his reputation came through
the ordeal untarnished. Having brought out an enlarged and
improved edition of the <i>Britannia</i> in 1607, he began to work on a
history of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to which he had been
urged by Lord Burghley in 1597. The first part of this history
dealing with the reign down to 1588 was published in 1615 under
the title <i>Annales rerum Anglicarum et Hibernicarum regnante
Elizabetha</i>. With regard to this work some controversy at
once arose over the author&rsquo;s treatment of Mary, queen of Scots.
It was asserted that Camden altered his original narrative in
order to please James I., and, moreover, that the account which
he is said to have given to his friend, the French historian,
Jacques de Thou, differed substantially from his own. It seems
doubtful if there is any truth in either of these charges. The
second part of this work, finished in 1617, was published, after
the author&rsquo;s death, at Leiden in 1625 and in London in 1627.
In 1622 Camden carried out a plan to found a history lectureship
at Oxford. He provided an endowment from some lands at
Bexley, and appointed as the first lecturer, his friend, Degory
Wheare. The present occupant of the position is known as the
Camden professor of ancient history. His concluding years were
mainly spent at Chislehurst, where he had taken up his residence
in 1609, and in spite of recurring illnesses he continued to work
at material for the improvement of the <i>Britannia</i> and kindred
subjects. He died at Chislehurst on the 9th of November 1623,
and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where a monument now
stands to his memory.</p>

<p>The <i>Britannia</i>, the first edition of which is dedicated to
Burghley, is a survey of the British islands written in elegant Latin.
It was first translated into English in 1610, probably under the
author&rsquo;s direction, and other translations have subsequently
appeared, the best of which is an edition edited by Richard
Gough and published in three volumes in 1789, and in four
volumes in 1806. The <i>Annales</i> has been translated into French,
and English translations appeared in 1635, 1675 and 1688.
The Latin version was published at Leiden in 1639 and 1677,
and under the editorship of T. Hearne at Oxford in 1717. In
addition to these works Camden compiled a Greek grammar,
<i>Institutio Graecae Grammatices Compendiaria</i>, which became
very popular, and he published an edition of the writings of Asser,
Giraldus Cambrensis, Thomas Walsingham and others, under the
title, <i>Anglica, Hibernica, Normannica, Cambrica, a veteribus
scripta</i>, published at Frankfort in 1602, and again in 1603.
He also drew up a list of the epitaphs in Westminster Abbey,
which was issued as <i>Reges, Reginae, Nobiles et alii in ecclesia
collegiata Beati Petri Westmonasterii sepulti</i>. This was enlarged
and published again in 1603 and 1606. In 1605 he published
his <i>Remains concerning Britain</i>, a book of collections from the
<i>Britannia</i>, which quickly passed through seven editions; and
he wrote an official account of the trial of the Gunpowder Plot
conspirators as <i>Actio in Henricum Garnetum, Societatis Jesuiticae
in Anglia superiorem et caeteros</i>.</p>

<p>Camden, who refused a knighthood, was a man of enormous
industry, and possessed a modest and friendly disposition.
He had a large number of influential friends, among whom were
Archbishop Ussher, Sir Robert Cotton, John Selden, the French
jurist Brisson, and Isaac Casaubon. His correspondence was
published in London in 1691 by Dr Thomas Smith under the title,
<i>Vita Gulielmi Camdeni et Illustrium virorum ad G. Camdenum
Epistolae</i>. This-volume also contains his <i>Memorabilia de seipso</i>;
his notes of the reign of James I.; and other interesting matter.
In 1838 the Camden Society was founded in his honour, and
much valuable work has been done under its auspices.</p>

sauces ($685,358 in 1900), and wooden ships and boats ($409,500
in 1900, and $361,089 in 1905, when the value of the iron and
steel ship-building industry was $4,673,504). The first settlers
on the site of Camden came in 1679, but for a century the settlement
consisted of isolated farms and a small group of houses
about the ferry by which travellers from the east crossed to
Philadelphia. The early settlers were largely Quakers. About
1773 Jacob Cooper laid out a town near the ferry, and gave it
the name Camden in honour of Lord Chancellor Camden, who
had been one of the strongest opponents of the Stamp Act.
The settlement, however, was known variously as &ldquo;Pluckemin,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Ferry&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cooper&rsquo;s Ferry&rdquo; until about the time of
the War of 1812. Until 1828 it was administratively a part
of the town of Newton, Gloucester county, but in that year,
with more than a thousand inhabitants, it was chartered as a
city under its present name. During the British occupation
of Philadelphia in the War of Independence, a British force
was stationed here, and Camden was the scene of several skirmishes
between the British troops and the New Jersey irregular
militia. Camden was the home of Walt Whitman from 1873
until his death.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMDEN,<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> a town and the county-seat of Kershaw county,
South Carolina, U.S.A., near the Wateree river, 33 m. N.E. of
Columbia. Pop. (1890) 3533; (1900) 2441; this decrease was
due to the separation from Camden during the decade of its
suburb &ldquo;Kirkwood,&rdquo; re-annexed in 1905; (1910) 3569. It is
served by the Atlantic Coast Line, the Seaboard Air Line and
the Southern railways. Camden is situated about 100 ft. above
the river, which is navigable to this point. The town is a winter
resort, chiefly for Northerners. Cotton, grain and rice are
produced in the vicinity, and there are some manufactories,
including cotton mills, a cotton-seed oil mill and planing mills.
Camden, first known as Pine Tree Hill, is one of the oldest
interior towns of the state, having been settled in 1758; in 1768
the present name was adopted in honour of Lord Chancellor
Camden. The town was first incorporated in 1791; its present
charter dates from 1890. For a year following the capture of
Charleston by the British in May 1780, during the War of
Independence, Camden was the centre of important military
operations. It was occupied by the British under Cornwallis in
June 1780, was well fortified and was garrisoned by a force
under Lord Rawdon. On the 16th of August Gen. Horatio
Gates, with an American force of about 3600, including some
Virginia militia under Charles Porterfield (1750-1780) and Gen.
Edward Stevens (1745-1820), and North Carolina militia under
Gen. Richard Caswell (1729-1789), was defeated here by the
British, about 2000 strong, under Lord Cornwallis, who had
joined Rawdon in anticipation of an attack by Gates. Soon
after the engagement began a large part of the Americans,
mostly North Carolina and Virginia militia, fled precipitately,
carrying Gates with them; but Baron De Kalb and the Maryland
troops fought bravely until overwhelmed by numbers, De Kalb
himself being mortally wounded. A monument was erected to
his memory in 1825, Lafayette laying the corner-stone. The
British loss in killed, wounded and missing was 324; the
American loss was about 800 or 900 killed and 1000 prisoners,
besides arms and baggage. On the 3rd of December Gates was
superseded by Gen. Nathanael Greene, who after Cornwallis had
left the Carolinas, advanced on Camden and arrived in the
neighbourhood on the 19th of April 1781. Considering his force
(about 1450) insufficient for an attack on the fortifications, he
withdrew a short distance north of Camden to an advantageous
position on Hobkirk&rsquo;s Hill, where on the 25th of April Rawdon,
with a force of only 950, took him somewhat by surprise and
drove him from the field. The casualties on each side were nearly
equal: American 271; British 258. On the 8th of May Rawdon
evacuated the town, after burning most of it. On the 24th of
February 1865, during the Civil War, a part of Gen. W.T. Sherman&rsquo;s
army entered Camden and burned stores of tobacco and cotton,
and several buildings. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">American War of Independence</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMEL<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> (from the Arabic <i>Djemal</i> or the Heb. <i>Gamal</i>), the
name of the single-humped Arabian <i>Camelus dromedarius</i>, but
also applied to the two-humped central Asian <i>C. bactrianus</i> and
to the extinct relatives of both. The characteristics of camels
and their systematic position are discussed under the headings
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tylopoda</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Artiodactyla</a></span>. The two living species are
distinguishable at a glance. It may be mentioned that the
Bactrian camel, which is a shorter-legged and more ponderous
animal than the Arabian species, grows an enormously long and
thick winter coat, which is shed in blanket-like masses in spring.
The Arabian camel, which is used not only in the country from
which it takes its name, but also in North Africa and India, and
has been introduced into Australia and North America, is known
only as a domesticated animal. On the other hand, the Bactrian
species, which is employed throughout a large tract of central
Asia in the domesticated condition, appears, according to recent
researches, to exist in the wild state in some of the central
Asian deserts. From the examination of specimens collected by
Dr Sven Hedin, Professor W. Leche shows that the wild Bactrian
camel differs from the domesticated breed of central Asia in the
following external characters: the humps are smaller; the long
hair does not occupy nearly so much of the body; the colour is
much more rufous; and the ears and muzzle are shorter. Many
important differences are also recorded between the skulls of the
two animals, and it is especially noteworthy that the last lower
molar is smaller in the wild than in the tame race. In connexion
with this point it should be noticed that, unlike what occurs in
the yak, the wild animal is not larger than the tame one, although
it is incorrect to say that the former is decidedly the inferior of
the latter in point of stature. Dr Leche also institutes a
comparison between the skeletons of the wild and the tame Bactrian
camel with the remains of certain fossil Asiatic camels, namely,
<i>Camelus knoblochi</i> from Sarepta, Russia, and <i>C. alutensis</i>
from the Aluta valley, Rumania. This comparison leads to the
important conclusion that the wild Bactrian <i>Camelus bactrianus
ferus</i> comes much nearer to the fossil species than it does to the
domesticated breed, the resemblance being specially noticeable
in the absolutely and relatively small size of the last molar. In
view of these differences from the domesticated breed, and the
resemblance of the skull or lower jaw to that of the extinct
European species, it becomes practically impossible to regard
the wild camels as the offspring of animals that have escaped
from captivity.</p>

<p>On the latter hypothesis it has been generally assumed that
the wild camels are the descendants of droves of the domesticated
breed which escaped when certain central Asian cities were
overwhelmed by sand-storms. This theory, according to
Professor Leche, is rendered improbable by Dr Sven Hedin&rsquo;s
observations on the habits and mode of life of the wild camel.
The habitat of the latter extends from the lower course of the
Keria river to the desert at the termination of that river, and
thence to the neighbourhood of the Achik, the ancient bed of the
Tarim river. These animals also occur in the desert district
south of the Tarim; but are most abundant in the deserts and
mountains to the southward of Kuruktagh, where there are a
few brackish-water pools, and are also common in the barren
mountains between Kuruktagh and Choetagh. Large herds
have also been observed in the deserts near Altyntagh. The
capacity of camels for travelling long distances without
water&mdash;owing to special structural modifications in the stomach&mdash;is
familiar to all. That the Arabian species was one of the
earliest animals to be domesticated is evident from the record
of Scripture, where six thousand camels are said to have formed
part of the wealth of the patriarch Job. Camels also formed
part of the present which Pharaoh gave to Abraham, and it was
to a company of Ishmaelites travelling from Gilead to Egypt on
camels, laden with spices, much as their Arabian descendants do
at the present day, that Joseph was sold by his brothers.</p>

<p>The hump (or humps) varies in size according to the condition
of the animal, becoming small and flaccid after hard work and
poor diet.</p>

<p>During the rutting-season male camels become exceedingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>
savage and dangerous, uttering a loud bubbling roar and engaging
in fierce contests with their fellows. The female carries her
young for fully eleven months, and produces only one calf at a
time, which she suckles for a year. Eight days after birth the
young Arabian camel stands 3 ft. high, but does not reach its
full growth till its sixteenth or seventeenth year; it lives from
forty to fifty years. The flesh of the young camel resembles veal,
and is a favourite food of the Arabs, while camel&rsquo;s milk forms
an excellent and highly nutritious beverage, although it does
not furnish butter. The long hair is shorn every summer, and
woven into a variety of stuffs used by the Arab for clothing
himself and his family, and covering his tent. It was in raiment
of camel&rsquo;s hair that John the Baptist appeared as a preacher.
The hair imported into Europe is chiefly used in the manufacture
of small brushes used by painters, while the thick hide is formed
into a very durable leather. The droppings are used as fuel, and
from the incinerated remains of these sal-ammoniac is extracted,
which was at one time largely exported from Egypt.</p>

<p>The Bactrian camel is, if possible, of still more importance
to many of the central Asian Mongol races, supplying them
alike with food and raiment. It is, however, as &ldquo;the ship of the
desert,&rdquo; without which vast tracts of the earth&rsquo;s surface could
scarcely be explored, that the camel is specially valuable. In
its fourth year its training as a beast of burden begins, when it
is taught to kneel and to rise at a given signal, and is gradually
accustomed to bear increasing loads. These vary in weight
from 500 to 1000 lb., according to the variety of camel employed,
for of the Arabian camel there are almost as many breeds as
there are of the horse. When crossing a desert camels are
expected to carry their loads 25 m. a day for three days without
drink, getting a supply of water, however, on the fourth; but
the fleeter breeds will carry their rider and a bag of water 50 m.
a day for five days without drinking. When too heavily laden
the camel refuses to rise, but on the march it is exceedingly
patient under its burden, only yielding beneath it to die.
Relieved from its load it does not, like other animals, seek the
shade, even when that is to be found, but prefers to kneel beside
its burden in the broad glare of the sun, seeming to luxuriate
in the burning sand. When overtaken by a dust-storm it falls
on its knees, and stretching its neck along the sand, closes its
nostrils and remains thus motionless till the atmosphere clears;
and in this position it affords some shelter to its driver, who,
wrapping his face in his mantle, crouches behind his beast.</p>

<p>The food of the camel consists chiefly of the leaves of trees,
shrubs and dry hard vegetables, which it is enabled to tear down
and masticate by means of its powerful front teeth. As regards
temperament, if, writes Sir F. Palgrave, &ldquo;docile means stupid,
well and good; in such a case the camel is the very model of
docility. But if the epithet is intended to designate an animal
that takes an interest in its rider so far as a beast can, that in
some way understands his intentions, or shares them in a subordinate
fashion, that obeys from a sort of submissive or half-fellow-feeling
with his master, like the horse or elephant, then
I say that the camel is by no means docile&mdash;very much the
contrary. He takes no heed of his rider, pays no attention
whether he be on his back or not, walks straight on when once
set agoing, merely because he is too stupid to turn aside, and
then should some tempting thorn or green branch allure him out
of the path, continues to walk on in the new direction simply
because he is too dull to turn back into the right road. In a
word, he is from first to last an undomesticated and savage
animal rendered serviceable by stupidity alone, without much
skill on his master&rsquo;s part, or any co-operation on his own, save
that of an extreme passiveness. Neither attachment nor even
habit impresses him; never tame, though not wide-awake enough
to be exactly wild.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Biblical expression (Matt. xix. 24, &amp;c.), &ldquo;it is easier for a camel
to go through a needle&rsquo;s eye,&rdquo; &amp;c., is sometimes explained by saying
that the &ldquo;needle&rsquo;s eye&rdquo; means the small gate which is opened in the
great gate of a city, when the latter is closed for the night; but
recent criticism (<i>e.g.</i> Post in <i>Hastings&rsquo; Dict.</i>, under &ldquo;Camel&rdquo;) throws
doubt on this explanation, and assumes that the more violent hyperbole
is intended.  There is a various reading <span class="grk" title="Khamilos">&#954;&#940;&#956;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> (cable) for <span class="grk" title="Khamaelos">&#954;&#940;&#956;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>

English politician and art patron, was a nephew of the 1st earl
of Chatham. He sat in parliament from 1761 till 1784, siding
against his uncle and following George Grenville, who was also
a relative; and in 1784 he was raised to the peerage. He
dabbled in architecture and the arts generally, and was a prominent
figure in the artistic circles of his day. His son <span class="sc">Thomas
Pitt</span>, 2nd Baron Camelford (1775-1804), who succeeded him
in 1793, had an adventurous and misspent career in the navy,
but is principally remembered for his death in a duel with
Mr Best on the 10th of March 1804, the title becoming extinct.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMELLIA,<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> a genus or subgenus of evergreen trees or shrubs
belonging to the natural order Ternstroemiaceae, with thick
dark shining leaves and handsome white or rose-coloured
flowers. The name <i>Camellia</i> was given by Linnaeus in honour
of George Joseph Camellus or Kamel, a Moravian Jesuit who
travelled in Asia and wrote an account of the plants of the
Philippine Island, Luzon, which is included in the third volume
of John Ray&rsquo;s <i>Historia Plantarum</i> (1704). Modern botanists
are agreed that the tea-plant, placed by Linnaeus in a separate
genus, <i>Thea</i>, is too nearly allied to <i>Camellia</i> to admit of the
two being regarded as distinct genera. <i>Thea</i> and <i>Camellia</i> are
therefore now considered to represent one genus, which has been
generally called <i>Camellia</i>, but more correctly <i>Thea</i>, as this name
was the earlier of the two. Under the latter view <i>Camellia</i> is
regarded as a subgenus or section of <i>Thea</i>. It contains about
eight species, natives of India, China and Japan. Most of the
numerous cultivated forms are horticultural products of <i>C.
japonica</i>, a native of China and Japan, which was introduced
into Europe by Lord Petre in 1739. The wild plant has red
flowers, recalling those of the wild rose, but most of the cultivated
forms are double. In the variety <i>anemonaeflora</i> nearly all the
stamens have become transformed into small petaloid structures
which give the flower the appearance of a double anemone.</p>

<p>Another species, <i>C. reticulata</i>, a native of Hongkong, is also
prized for its handsome flowers, larger than those of <i>C. japonica</i>,
which are of a bright rose colour and as known in cultivation
semi-double or double.</p>

<p>Both <i>C. sasanqua</i> and <i>C. drupifera</i>, the former inhabiting
Japan and China, the latter Cochin-China and the mountains
of India, are oil-yielding plants. The oil of <i>C. sasanqua</i> (of which
sasankwa is the native Japanese name) has an agreeable odour
and is used for many domestic purposes. It is obtained from
the seeds by subjecting them to pressure sufficient to reduce them
to a coarse powder, and then boiling and again pressing the
crushed material. The leaves are also used in the form of a
decoction by the Japanese women for washing their hair; and
in a dried state they are mixed with tea on account of their
pleasant flavour. The oil of <i>C. drupifera</i>, which is closely allied
to <i>C. sasanqua</i>, is used medicinally in Cochin-China. The flowers
of these two species, unlike those of <i>C. japonica</i> and <i>C. reticulata</i>,
are odoriferous.</p>

<p>Camellias, though generally grown in the cool greenhouse,
are hardy in the south of England and the south-west of Scotland
and Ireland. They grow best in a rich compost of sandy peat
and loam, and should not be allowed to get too dry at the roots;
a liberal supply of water is especially necessary during the
flowering period. The best position&mdash;when grown out of doors&mdash;is
one facing north or north-west, with a wall or hedge behind
for protection from cold winds. July is the best time for planting;
care must be taken that the roots are evenly spread, not
matted into a ball.</p>

<p>The plants are propagated by layers or cuttings, and the
single-flowered ones also by seeds. Cuttings are taken in
August and placed in sandy peat or loam in a cold shaded frame.
In the following spring those which have struck are placed in a
gentle heat, and in September or October the rooted plants are
potted off. Camellias are also propagated by grafting or inarching
in early spring on stocks of the common variety of <i>C. japonica.</i></p>

<p>The scale insect sometimes attacks the camellia.   To remove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span>
the white scale, the plants are washed with a sponge and solution
of soft soap as soon as their growth is completed, and again
before the buds begin to swell. The brown scale may be got rid
of by repeated washings with one of the many insecticides, but
it should be applied at a temperature of 90¬∞.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMEO,<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> a term of doubtful origin, applied in the first instance
to engraved work executed in relief on hard or precious stones.
It is also applied to imitations of such stones in glass, called
&ldquo;pastes,&rdquo; or on the shells of molluscous animals. A cameo is
therefore the converse of an intaglio, which consists of an
incised or sunk engraving in the same class of materials. For
the history of this branch of art, and for an account of some of
its most remarkable examples, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gem</a></span>.</p>

<p>The origin of the word is doubtful and has been a matter of
copious controversy. The <i>New English Dictionary</i> quotes its use
in a Sarum inventory of 1222, <i>&rdquo;lapis unus cameu&rdquo;</i> and <i>&rdquo;magnus
camehu.&rdquo;</i> The word is in current use in the 13th century. Thus
Matthew Paris, in his Life of Abbot Leofric of St Albans, in the
<i>Abbatum S. Albani Vitae,</i> says: <i>&rdquo;retentis quibusdam nobilibus
lapidibus insculptis, quos camaeos vulgariter appellamus.&rdquo;</i> In
variant forms the word has found its way into most languages, <i>e.g.</i>
Latin, <i>camahutus, camahelus, camaynus</i>; Italian, <i>chammeo, chameo</i>;
French, <i>camahieu, chemahou, camaut, camaieu</i>. The following may
be mentioned among the derivations that have been proposed:&mdash;von
Hammer: <i>camaut</i>, the hump of a camel; Littr√© and others:
<i>camateum</i>, an assumed Low Latin form from <span class="grk" title="kamateuein">&#954;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span> and

<p><span class="bold">CAMERA<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> (a Latin adaptation of Gr. <span class="grk" title="kamara">&#954;&#945;&#956;&#940;&#961;&#945;</span>, an arched
chamber), in law, a word applied at one time to the English
judges&rsquo; chambers in Serjeants&rsquo; Inn, as distinct from their bench
in Westminster Hall. It was afterwards applied to the judges&rsquo;
private room behind the court, and, hence, in the phrase <i>in
camera</i>, to cases heard in private, <i>i.e.</i> in chambers. So far as
criminal cases are concerned, the courts have no power to hear
them in private, nor have they any power to order adults (men
or women) out of court during the hearing. In civil proceedings
at common law, it may also be laid down that the public cannot
be excluded from the court; in <i>Malan</i> v. <i>Young</i>, 1889, 6 T.L.R.
68, Mr Justice Denman held that he had power to hear the case
<i>in camera</i>, but he afterwards stated that there was considerable
doubt among the judges as to the power to hear cases <i>in camera</i>,
even by consent, and the case was, by consent of the parties,
finally proceeded with before the judge <i>as arbitrator</i>. In the court
of chancery it is the practice to hear in private cases affecting
wards of the court and lunatics, family disputes (by consent),
and cases where a public trial would defeat the object of the
action (<i>Andrew</i> v. <i>Raeburn</i>, 1874, L.R. 9 Ch. 522). In an action
for infringement of a patent for a chemical process the defendant
was allowed to state a secret process <i>in camera (Badische Anilin
und Soda Fabrik</i> v. <i>Gillman</i>, 1883, 24 Ch. D. 156). The Court
of Appeal has decided that it has power to sit in private; in
<i>Mellor</i> v. <i>Thompson</i>, 1885, 31 Ch. D. 55, it was stated that a
public hearing would defeat the object of the action, and render
the respondent&rsquo;s success in the appeal useless. In matrimonial
causes, the divorce court, following the practice of the ecclesiastical
courts under the provisions of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857,
s. 22, hears suits for nullity of marriage on physical grounds
<i>in camera</i>, but not petitions for dissolution of marriage, which
must be heard in open court. It was also decided in <i>Druce</i> v.
<i>Druce</i>, 1903, 19 T.L.R. 387, that, in cases for judicial separation
the court has jurisdiction to hear the case <i>in camera</i>, where it is
satisfied that justice cannot be done by hearing the case in public.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMERA LUCIDA,<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> an optical instrument invented by Dr
William Hyde Wollaston for drawing in perspective. Closing
one eye and looking vertically downwards with the other through
a slip of plain glass, <i>e.g.</i> a microscope cover-glass, held close to
the eye and inclined at an angle of 45¬∞ to the horizon, one can
see the images of objects in front, formed by reflection from the
surface of the glass, and at the same time one can also see through
the transparent glass. The virtual images of the objects appear
projected on the surface of a sheet of paper placed beneath the
slip of glass, and their outline can be accurately traced with a
pencil. This is the simplest form of the camera lucida. The
image (see fig. 1) is, however, inverted  and
perverted, and it is not very bright owing to
the poor reflecting power of unsilvered glass.
The brightness of the image is sometimes increased
by silvering the glass; and on removing
a small portion of the silver the observer can
see the image with part of the pupil while he
sees the paper through the unsilvered aperture
with the remaining part. This form of the instrument
is often used in conjunction with the
microscope, the mirror being attached to the eye-piece and the
tube of the microscope being placed horizontally.</p>

<p>About the beginning of the 19th century Dr Wollaston invented
a simple form of the camera lucida which gives bright
and erect images. A four-sided prism of glass is constructed
having one angle of 90¬∞, the opposite angle of 135¬∞, and the two
remaining angles each of 67¬Ω¬∞. This is represented in cross-section
and in position in fig. 2. When the pupil of the eye is
held half over the edge of the prism a,
one sees the image of the object with
one half of the pupil and the paper with
the other half. The image is formed by
successive total reflection at the surfaces
b c and a b. In the first place an inverted
image (first image) is formed in
the face b c, and then an image of this
image is formed in a b, and it is the
outline of this second image seen projected
on the paper that is traced by the
pencil. It is desirable for two reasons that the image should
lie in the plane of the paper, and this can be secured by placing
a suitable lens between the object and the prism. If the image
does not lie in the plane of the paper, it is impossible to see it
and the pencil-point clearly at the same time. Moreover, any
slight movement of the head will cause the image to appear to
move relatively to the paper, and will render it difficult to obtain
an accurate drawing.</p>

<p>Before the application of photography, the camera lucida was
of considerable importance to draughtsmen. The advantages
claimed for it were its cheapness, smallness and portability;
that there was no appreciable distortion, and that its field was
much larger than that of the camera obscura. It was used largely
for copying, for reducing or for enlarging existing drawings. It
will readily be understood, for example, that a copy will be
half-size if the distance of the object from the instrument is
double the distance of the instrument from the copy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMERA OBSCURA,<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> an optical apparatus consisting of a
darkened chamber (for which its name is the Latin rendering)
at the top of which is placed a box or lantern containing a convex
lens and sloping mirror, or a prism combining the lens and
mirror. If we hold a common reading lens (a magnifying lens)
in front of a lamp or some other bright object and at some
distance from it, and if we hold a sheet of paper vertically at a
suitable distance behind the lens, we see depicted on the paper
an image of the lamp. This image is inverted and perverted.
If now we place a plane
mirror (<i>e.g.</i> a lady&rsquo;s hand
glass) behind the lens and
inclined at an angle of 45¬∞ to
the horizon so as to reflect
the rays of light vertically
downwards, we can produce
on a horizontal sheet of
paper an unperverted image
of the bright object (fig. 1), <i>i.e.</i> the image has the same appearance
as the object and is not perverted as when the reflection of a
printed page is viewed in a mirror. This is the principle of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span>
camera obscura, which was extensively used in sketching from
nature before the introduction of photography, although it is
now scarcely to be seen except as an interesting side-show at
places of popular resort. The image formed on the paper may
be traced out by a pencil, and it will be noticed that in this case
the image is real&mdash;not virtual as in the case of the camera
lucida. Generally the mirror and lens are combined into a
single piece of worked glass represented in section in fig. 2.
Rays from external objects are first refracted
at the convex surface <i>a b,</i> then totally
reflected at the plane surface <i>a c,</i> and finally
refracted at the concave surface <i>b c</i> (fig. 2)
so as to form an image on the sheet of paper
<i>d e.</i> The curved surfaces take the place of
the lens in fig. 1, and the plane surface performs
the function of the mirror. The prism
<i>a b c</i> is fixed at the top of a small tent furnished
with opaque curtains so as to prevent the diffused daylight
from overpowering the image on the paper, and in the
darkened tent the images of external objects are seen very
distinctly.</p>

<p>Quite recently, the camera obscura has come into use with
submarine vessels, the <i>periscope</i> being simply a camera obscura
under a new name.</p>
<div class="author">(C. J. J.)</div>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The invention of this instrument has generally been
ascribed, as in the ninth edition of this work, to the famous
Neapolitan savant of the 16th century, Giovanni Battista della
Porta, but as a matter of fact the principle of the simple camera
obscura, or darkened chamber with a small aperture in a window
or shutter, was well known and in practical use for observing
eclipses long before his time. He was anticipated in the improvements
he claimed to have made in it, and all he seems really to
have done was to popularize it. The increasing importance
of the camera obscura as a photographic instrument makes it
desirable to bring together what is known of its early history,
which is far more extensive than is usually recognized. In
southern climes, where during the summer heat it is usual to
close the rooms from the glare of the sunshine outside, we may
often see depicted on the walls vivid inverted images of outside
objects formed by the light reflected from them passing through
chinks or small apertures in doors or window-shutters. From
the opening passage of Euclid&rsquo;s <i>Optics</i> (<i>c.</i> 300 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>), which
formed the foundation for some of the earlier middle age treatises
on geometrical perspective, it would appear that the above
phenomena of the simple darkened room were used by him to
demonstrate the rectilinear propagation of light by the passage
of sunbeams or the projection of the images of objects through
small openings in windows, &amp;c. In the book known as Aristotle&rsquo;s
<i>Problems</i> (sect. xv. cap. 5) we find the correlated problem
of the image of the sun passing through a quadrilateral aperture
always appearing round, and he further notes the lunated image
of the eclipsed sun projected in the same way through the
interstices of foliage or lattice-work.</p>

<p>There are, however, very few allusions to these phenomena
in the later classical Greek and Roman writers, and we find the
first scientific investigation of them in the great optical treatise
of the Arabian philosopher Alhazen (<i>q.v.</i>), who died at Cairo in
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1038. He seems to have been well acquainted with the
projection of images of objects through small apertures, and to
have been the first to show that the arrival of the image of an
object at the concave surface of the common nerve&mdash;or the
retina&mdash;corresponds with the passage of light from an object
through an aperture in a darkened place, from which it falls
upon a surface facing the aperture. He also had some knowledge
of the properties of concave and convex lenses and mirrors in
forming images. Some two hundred years later, between
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1266 and 1279, these problems were taken up by three
almost contemporaneous writers on optics, two of whom, Roger
Bacon and John Peckham, were Englishmen, and Vitello or
Witelo, a Pole.</p>

<p>That Roger Bacon was acquainted with the principle of the
camera obscura is shown by his attempt at solving Aristotle&rsquo;s
problem stated above, in the treatise <i>De Speculis,</i> and also from
his references to Alhazen&rsquo;s experiments of the same kind, but
although Dr John Freind, in his <i>History of Physick,</i> has given him
the credit of the invention on the strength of a passage in the
<i>Perspectiva</i>, there is nothing to show that he constructed any
instrument of the kind. His arrangement of concave and plane
mirrors, by which the realistic images of objects inside the house
or in the street could be rendered visible though intangible,
there alluded to, may apply to a camera on Cardan&rsquo;s principle or
to a method of aerial projection by means of concave mirrors,
which Bacon was quite familiar with, and indeed was known
long before his time. On the strength of similar arrangements of
lenses and mirrors the invention of the camera obscura has also
been claimed for Leonard Digges, the author of <i>Pantometria</i>
(1571), who is said to have constructed a telescope from information
given in a book of Bacon&rsquo;s experiments.</p>

<p>Archbishop Peckham, or Pisanus, in his <i>Perspectiva Communis</i>
(1279), and Vitello, in his <i>Optics</i> (1270), also attempted the
solution of Aristotle&rsquo;s problem, but unsuccessfully. Vitello&rsquo;s
work is to a very great extent based upon Alhazen and some of
the earlier writers, and was first published in 1535. A later
edition was published, together with a translation of Alhazen,
by F. Risner in 1572.</p>

<p>The first practical step towards the development of the camera
obscura seems to have been made by the famous painter and
architect, Leon Battista Alberti, in 1437, contemporaneously
with the invention of printing. It is not clear, however, whether
his invention was a camera obscura or a show box, but in a
fragment of an anonymous biography of him, published in
Muratori&rsquo;s <i>Rerum Italicarum Scriptores</i> (xxv. 296), quoted by
Vasari, it is stated that he produced wonderfully painted
pictures, which were exhibited by him in some sort of small
closed box through a very small aperture, with great verisimilitude.
These demonstrations were of two kinds, one nocturnal,
showing the moon and bright stars, the other diurnal, for day
scenes. This description seems to refer to an arrangement of a
transparent painting illuminated either from the back or the front
and the image projected through a hole on to a white screen in a
darkened room, as described by Porta (<i>Mag. Nat.</i> xvii. cap. 7)
and figured by A. Kircher (<i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae</i>), who
notes elsewhere that Porta had taken some arrangement of projecting
images from an Albertus, whom he distinguished from
Albertus Magnus, and who was probably L.B. Alberti, to whom
Porta also refers, but not in this connexion.</p>

<p>G.B.I.T. Libri-Carucci dalla Sommaja (1803-1869), in his
account of the invention of the camera obscura in Italy (<i>Histoire
des sciences math√©matiques en Italic,</i> iv. 303), makes no mention
of Alberti, but draws attention to an unpublished MS. of Leonardo
da Vinci, which was first noticed by Venturi in 1797, and has
since been published in facsimile in vol. ii. of J.G.F. Ravaisson-Mollien&rsquo;s
reproductions of the MSS. in the Institut de France at
Paris (MS. <i>D</i>, fol. 8 <i>recto</i>). After discussing the structure of the
eye he gives an experiment in which the appearance of the
reversed images of outside objects on a piece of paper held in
front of a small hole in a darkened room, with their forms and
colours, is quite clearly described and explained with a diagram,
as an illustration of the phenomena of vision. Another similar
passage is quoted by Richter from folio 404b of the reproduction
of the <i>Codice Atlantico,</i> in Milan, published by the Italian
government. These are probably the earliest distinct accounts
of the natural phenomena of the camera obscura, but remained
unpublished for some three centuries. Leonardo also discussed
the old Aristotelian problem of the rotundity of the sun&rsquo;s image
after passing through an angular aperture, but not so successfully
as Maurolycus. He has also given methods of measuring the
sun&rsquo;s distance by means of images thrown on screens through
small apertures. He was well acquainted with the use of magnifying
glasses and suggested a kind of telescope for viewing the
moon, but does not seem to have thought of applying a lens to
the camera.</p>

<p>The first published account of the simple camera obscura was
discovered by Libri in a translation of the <i>Architecture</i> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>
Vitruvius, with commentary by Cesare Caesariano, one of the
architects of Milan cathedral, published at Conio in 1521, shortly
after the death of Leonardo, and some twenty years before
Porta was born. He describes an experiment made by a
Benedictine monk and architect, Dom Papnutio or Panuce, of
the same kind as Leonardo&rsquo;s but without the demonstration.</p>

<p>About the same time Francesco Maurolico, or Maurolycus,
the eminent mathematician of Messina, in his <i>Theoremata de
Lumine et Umbra</i>, written in 1521, fully investigated the optical
problems connected with vision and the passage of rays of light
through small apertures with and without lenses, and made
great advances in this direction over his predecessors. He was
the first correctly to solve Aristotle&rsquo;s problem, stated above,
and to apply it practically to solar observations in a darkened
room (<i>Cosmographia</i>, 1535). Erasmus Reinhold has described
the method in his edition of G. Purbach&rsquo;s <i>Theoricae Novae
Planetarum</i> (1542), and probably got it from Maurolycus. He
says it can also be applied to terrestrial objects, though he only
used it for the sun. His pupil, Rainer Gemma-Frisius, used it
for the observation of the solar eclipse of January 1544 at
Louvain, and fully described the methods he adopted for making
measurements and drawings of the eclipsed sun, in his <i>De Radio
Astronomico et Geometrico</i> (1545). He says they can be used for
observation of the moon and stars and also for longitudes. The
same arrangement was used by Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, by
M. Moestlin and his pupil Kepler&mdash;the latter applying it in 1607
to the observation of a transit of Mercury&mdash;also by Johann
Fabricius, in 1611, for the first observations of sun-spots. It is
interesting to note this early employment of the camera obscura
in the field of astronomical research, in which its latest achievements
have been of such pre-eminent value.</p>

<p>The addition of optical appliances to the simple dark chamber
for the purpose of seeing what was going on outside, was first
described by Girolamo Cardan in his <i>De Subtilitate</i> (1550), as
noted by Libri. The sun shining, he fixed a round glass speculum
(<i>orbem e vitro</i>) in a window-shutter, and then closing it the images
of outside objects would be seen transmitted through the
aperture on to the opposite wall, or better, a white paper screen
suitably placed. The account is not very clear, but seems to
imply the use of a concave mirror rather than a lens, which
might be suggested by the word <i>orbem</i>. He refers to Maurolycus&rsquo;
work with concave specula.</p>

<p>We now come to Giovanni Battista della Porta, whose account
of the camera obscura in the first edition of the <i>Magia Naturalis,</i>
in four books (1558, lib. iv. cap. 2), is very similar to Caesariano&rsquo;s&mdash;a
darkened room, a pyramidal aperture towards the sun, and a
whitened wall or white paper screens, but no lens. He discloses
as a great secret the use of a concave speculum in front of the
aperture, to collect the rays passing through it, when the images
will be seen reversed, but by prolonging them beyond the centre
they would be seen larger and unreversed. This is much the
same as Cardan&rsquo;s method published eight years earlier, but
though more detailed is not very clear. He then notes the
application to portraiture and to painting by laying colours on
the projected images. Nothing is said about the use of a lens
or of solar observations. The second edition, in which he in the
same words discloses the use of a convex lens in the aperture as a
secret he had intended to keep, was not published till 1589,
thirty-one years after the first. In this interval the use of the
lens was discovered and clearly described by Daniello Barbaro, a
Venetian noble, patriarch of Aquileia, in his work <i>La Pratica
della perspettiva</i> (p. 192), published in 1568, or twenty-one
years before Porta&rsquo;s mention of it. The lens used by Barbaro
was an ordinary convex or old man&rsquo;s spectacle-glass; concave,
he says, will not do. He shows how the paper must be moved
till it is brought into the focus of the lens, the use of a diaphragm
to make the image clearer, and also the application of the method
for drawing in true perspective. That Barbaro was really the
first to apply the lens to the camera obscura is supported by
Marius Bettinus in his <i>Apiaria</i> (1645), and by Kaspar Schott in
his <i>Magia Universalis</i> (1657), the former taunting Porta with the
appropriation.</p>

<p>In an Italian translation of Euclid&rsquo;s <i>Optica</i>, with commentary,
Egnacio Danti (1573), after discussing the effects of plane,
convex and concave reflectors, fully describes the method of
showing reversed images passing through an aperture in a
darkened room, and shows how, by placing a mirror behind the
aperture, unreversed images might be obtained, both effects
being illustrated by diagrams. F. Risner, who died in 1580,
also in his <i>Opticae</i> (1606) very clearly explained the reversal of
the images of the simple camera obscura. He notes the convenience
of the method for solar observations and its previous
use by some of the observers already mentioned, as well as its
advantages for easily and accurately copying on an enlarged or
reduced scale, especially for chorographical or topographical
documents. This is probably the first notice of the application
of the camera to cartography and the reproduction of drawings,
which is one of its principal uses at the present time. In
the <i>Diversarum Speculationum Mathematicarum el Physicarum</i>
(1585), by the Venetian Giovanni Battista Benedetti, there is a
letter in which he discusses the simple camera obscura and
mentions the improvement some one had made in it by the use
of a double convex lens in the aperture; he also says that the
images could be made erect by reflection from any plane mirror.</p>

<p>Thus the use of the camera and of the lens with it was well
known before Porta published his second edition of the <i>Magia
Naturalis</i> in 1589. In this the description of the camera obscura
is in lib. xvii. cap. 6. The use of the convex lens, which is given
as a great secret, in place of the concave speculum of the first
edition, is not so clearly described as by Barbaro; the addition
of the concave speculum is proposed for making the images
larger and clearer, and also for making them erect, but no details
are given. He describes some entertaining peep-show arrangements,
possibly similar to Alberti&rsquo;s, and indicates how the dark
chamber with a concave speculum can be used for observing
eclipses. There is no mention whatever of a portable box or
construction beyond the darkened room, nor is there in his later
work, <i>De Refractione Optices Parte</i> (1593), in which he discusses
the analogy between vision and the simple dark room with an
aperture, but incorrectly. Though Porta&rsquo;s merits were undoubtedly
great, he did not invent or improve the camera
obscura. His only novelty was the use of it as a peep-show;
his descriptions of it are vague, but being published in a book of
general reference, which became popular, he acquired credit for
the invention.</p>

<p>The first to take up the camera obscura after Porta was Kepler,
who used it in the old way for solar observations in 1600, and
in his <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena</i> (1604) discusses the early
problems of the passages of light through small apertures, and
the rationale of the simple dark chamber. He was the first to
describe an instrument fitted with a sight and paper screen for
observing the diameters of the sun and moon in a dark room.
In his later book, <i>Dioptrice</i> (1611), he fully discusses refraction
and the use of lenses, showing the action of the double convex
lens in the camera obscura, with the principles which regulate
its use and the reason of the reversal of the image. He also
demonstrates how enlarged images can be produced and projected
on paper by using a concave lens at a suitable distance behind
the convex, as in modern telephotographic lenses. He was the
first to use the term <i>camera obscura</i>, and in a letter from Sir H.
Wotton written to Lord Bacon in 1620 we learn that Kepler had
made himself a portable dark tent fitted with a telescope lens
and used for sketching landscapes. Further, he extended the
work of Maurolycus, and demonstrated the exact analogy
between the eye and the camera and the arrangement by which
an inverted image is produced on the retina.</p>

<p>In 1609 the telescope came into use, and the danger of observing
the sun with it was soon discovered. In 1611 Johann
Fabricius published his observations of sun-spots and describes
how he and his father fell back upon the old method of projecting
the sun&rsquo;s image in a darkened room, finding that they could
observe the spots just as well as with the telescope. They do
not seem to have used a lens, or thought of using the telescope
for projecting an enlarged imase on Kepler&rsquo;s principle. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>
was done in 1612 by Christoph Schemer, who fully described his
method of solar observation in the <i>Rosa Ursina</i> (1630), demonstrating
very clearly and practically the advantages and disadvantages
of using the camera, without a lens, with a single
convex lens, and with a telescopic combination of convex
object-glass and concave enlarging lens, the last arrangement
being mounted with an adjustable screen or tablet on an equatorial
stand. Most of the earlier astronomical work was done
in a darkened room, but here we first find the dark chamber
constructed of wooden rods covered with cloth or paper, and
used separately to screen the observing-tablet.</p>

<p>Various writers on optics in the 17th century discussed the
principle of the simple dark chamber alone and with single or
compound lenses, among them Jean Tarde (<i>Les Astres de Borbon</i>,
1623); Descartes, the pupil of Kepler (<i>Dioptrique</i>, 1637);
Bettinus (<i>Apiaria</i>, 1645); A. Kircher (<i>Ars Magna Lucis et
Umbrae</i>, 1646); J. Hevelius (<i>Selenographia</i>, 1647); Schott
(<i>Magia Universalis Naturae et Artis</i>, 1674); C.F.M. Deschales
(<i>Cursus, seu Mundus Mathematicus</i>, 1674); Z. Traber (<i>Nervus
Opticus</i>, 1675), but their accounts are generally more interesting
theoretically than as recording progress in the practical use and
development of the instrument.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of the camera obscura in England is
probably in Francis Bacon&rsquo;s <i>De Augmentis Scientiarum</i>, but it is
only as an illustration of the projected images showing better
on a white screen than on a black one. Sir H. Wotton&rsquo;s letter
of 1620, already noted, was not published till 1651 (<i>Reliquiae
Wottonianae</i>, p. 141), but in 1658 a description of Kepler&rsquo;s portable
tent camera for sketching, taken from it, was published in a work
called <i>Graphice, or the most excellent Art of Painting</i>, but no
mention is made of Kepler. In W. Oughtred&rsquo;s English edition
(1633) of the <i>R√©cr√©ations math√©matiques</i> (1627) of Jean Leurechon
(&ldquo;Henry van Etten&rdquo;) there is a quaint description, with
figures, of the simple dark chamber with aperture, and also of a
sort of tent with a lens in it and the projection on an inner wall
of the face of a man standing outside. The English translation
of Porta&rsquo;s <i>Natural Magick</i> was published in 1658.</p>

<p>Robert Boyle seems to have been the first to construct a box
camera with lens for viewing landscapes. It is mentioned in his
essay <i>On the Systematic or Cosmical Qualities of Things</i> (ch. vi.),
written about 1570, as having been made several years before
and since imitated and improved. It could be extended or
shortened like a telescope. At one end of it paper was stretched,
and at the other a convex lens was fitted in a hole, the image
being viewed through an aperture at the top of the box. Robert
Hooke, who was some time Boyle&rsquo;s assistant, described (<i>Phil.
Trans.</i>, 1668, 3, p. 741) a camera lucida on the principle of the
magic lantern, in which the images of illuminated and inverted
objects were projected on any desired scale by means of a broad
convex lens through an aperture into a room where they were
viewed by the spectators. If the objects could not be inverted,
another lens was used for erecting the images. From Hooke&rsquo;s
<i>Posthumous Works</i> (1705), p. 127, we find that in one of the
Cutlerian lectures on Light delivered in 1680, he illustrated the
phenomena of vision by a darkened room, or perspective box,
of a peculiar pattern, the back part, with a concave white screen
at the end of it, being cylindrical and capable of being moved
in and out, while the fore part was conical, a double convex
lens being fixed in a hole in front. The image was viewed
through a large hole in the side. It was between 4 and 5 ft.
long.</p>

<p>Johann Zahn, in his <i>Oculus Artificialis Teledioptricus</i> (1685-1686),
described and figured two forms of portable box cameras
with lenses. One was a wooden box with a projecting tube in
which a combination of a concave with a convex lens was fitted,
for throwing an enlarged image upon the focusing screen,
which in its proportions and application is very similar to our
modern telephotographic objectives. The image was first thrown
upon an inclined mirror and then reflected upwards to a paper
screen on the top of the box. In an earlier form the image is
thrown upon a vertical thin paper screen and viewed through a
hole in the back of the camera. There is a great deal of practical
information on lenses in connexion with the camera and other
optical instruments, and the book is valuable as a repertory
of early practical optics, also for the numerous references to
and extracts from previous writers. An improved edition was
published in 1702.</p>

<p>Most of the writers already noticed worked out the problems
connected with the projection of images in the camera obscura
more by actual practice than by calculation, but William
Molyneux, of Dublin, seems to have been the first to treat them
mathematically in his <i>Dioptrica Nova</i> (1692), which was also the
first work in English on the subject, and is otherwise an interesting
book. He has fully discussed the optical theory of the dark
chamber, with and without a lens, and its analogy to the eye,
also several optical problems relating to lenses of various forms
and their combinations for telescopic projection, rules for finding
foci, &amp;c. He does not, however, mention the camera obscura
as an instrument in use, but in John Harris&rsquo;s <i>Lexicon Technicum</i>
(1704) we find that the camera obscura with the arrangement
called the &ldquo;scioptric ball,&rdquo; and known as <i>scioptricks</i>, was on sale
in London, and after this must have been in common use as a
sketching instrument or as a show.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton, in his <i>Opticks</i> (1704), explains the principle
of the camera obscura with single convex lens and its analogy
with vision in illustration of his seventh axiom, which aptly
embodies the correct solution of Aristotle&rsquo;s old problem. He
also made great use of the simple dark chamber for his optical
experiments with prisms, &amp;c. Joseph Priestley (1772) mentions
the application of the solar microscope, both to the small and
portable and the large camera obscura. Many patterns of these
two forms for sketching and for viewing surrounding scenes
are described in W.J.&rsquo;s Gravesande&rsquo;s <i>Essai de perspective</i>
(1711), Robert Smith&rsquo;s <i>Compleat System of Optics</i> (1738), Joseph
Harris&rsquo;s <i>Treatise on Optics</i> (1775), Charles Hutton&rsquo;s <i>Philosophical
and Mathematical Dictionary</i>, and other books on optics
and physics of that period. The camera obscura was first
applied to photography (<i>q.v.</i>) probably about 1794, by Thomas
Wedgwood. His experiments with Sir Humphrey Davy in
endeavouring to fix the images of natural objects as seen in the
camera were published in 1802 (<i>Journ. Roy. Inst.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMERARIUS, JOACHIM<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (1500-1574), German classical
scholar, was born at Bamberg on the 12th of April 1500. His
family name was Liebhard, but he was generally called Kammermeister,
previous members of his family having held the office
of chamberlain (<i>camerarius</i>) to the bishops of Bamberg. He
studied at Leipzig, Erfurt and Wittenberg, where he became
intimate with Melanchthon. For some years he was teacher
of history and Greek at the gymnasium, Nuremberg. In 1530
he was sent as deputy for Nuremberg to the diet of Augsburg,
where he rendered important assistance to Melanchthon in
drawing up the Confession of Augsburg. Five years later he
was commissioned by Duke Ulrich of W√ºrttemberg to reorganize
the university of T√ºbingen; and in 1541 he rendered a similar
service at Leipzig, where the remainder of his life was chiefly
spent. He translated into Latin Herodotus, Demosthenes,
Xenophon, Homer, Theocritus, Sophocles, Lucian, Theodoretus,
Nicephorus and other Greek writers. He published upwards of
150 works, including a <i>Catalogue of the Bishops of the Principal
Sees</i>; <i>Greek Epistles</i>; <i>Accounts of his Journeys</i>, in Latin verse;
a Commentary on Plautus; a treatise on Numismatics; <i>Euclid</i>
in Latin; and the Lives of Helius Eobanus Hessus, George of
Anhalt and Philip Melanchthon. His <i>Epistolae Familiares</i>
(published after his death) are a valuable contribution to the
history of his time. He played an important part in the Reformation
movement, and his advice was frequently sought by
leading men. In 1535 he entered into a correspondence with
Francis I. as to the possibility of a reconciliation between the
Catholic and Protestant creeds; and in 1568 Maximilian II.
sent for him to Vienna to consult him on the same subject.
He died at Leipzig on the 17th of April 1574.</p>

465, if not sooner; Treia is now combined with it) of the Marches,
Italy, in the province of Macerata, 6 m. S. of the railway
station of Castelraimondo (to which there is an electric tramway)
which is 24 m. W. of Macerata; 2148 ft. above sea-level.
Pop. (1901) of town, 4005; of commune, 12,083. The cathedral
is modern, the older building having fallen in 1799; the church
of S. Venanzio suffered similarly, but preserves a portal of the
15th century. The citadel, perhaps constructed from the plans
of Leonardo da Vinci, dates from 1503. Camerino occupies
the site of the ancient Camerinum, the inhabitants of which
(<i>Camertes Umbri</i>) became allies of the Romans in 310 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> (at
the time of the attack on the Etruscans in the Ciminian Forest).

Catiline, and is frequently mentioned in the Civil Wars; under
the empire it was a <i>municipium</i>. It belonged to ancient Umbria,
but was on the borders of Picenum. No ancient buildings are
visible, the Roman level lying as much as 30 ft. below the modern.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMERON, JOHN<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> (1579-1623), Scottish theologian, was born
at Glasgow about 1579, and received his early education in his
native city. After having taught Greek in the university for
twelve months, he removed to Bordeaux, where he was soon
appointed a regent in the college of Bergerac. He did not
remain long at Bordeaux, but accepted the offer of a chair of
philosophy at Sedan, where he passed two years. He then
returned to Bordeaux, and in the beginning of 1604 he was
nominated one of the students of divinity who were maintained
at the expense of the church, and who for the period of four
years were at liberty to prosecute their studies in any Protestant
seminary. During this period he acted as tutor to the two sons
of Calignon, chancellor of Navarre. They spent one year at
Paris, and two at Geneva, whence they removed to Heidelberg.
In this university, on the 4th of April 1608, he gave a public
proof of his ability by maintaining a series of theses, <i>De triplici
Dei cum Homine Foedere</i>, which were printed among his works.
The same year he was recalled to Bordeaux, where he was
appointed the colleague of Dr Primrose; and when Francis
Gomarus was removed to Leiden, Cameron, in 1618, was
appointed professor of divinity at Saumur, the principal seminary
of the French Protestants.</p>

<p>In 1620 the progress of the civil troubles in France obliged
Cameron to seek refuge for himself and family in England. For
a short time he read private lectures on divinity in London;
and in 1622 the king appointed him principal of the university
of Glasgow in the room of Robert Boyd, who had been removed
from his office in consequence of his adherence to Presbyterianism.
Cameron was prepared to accept Episcopacy, and was
cordially disliked for his adherence to the doctrine of passive
obedience. He resigned his office in less than a year.</p>

<p>He returned to France, and lived at Saumur. After an
interval of a year he was appointed professor of divinity at
Montauban. The country was still torn by civil and religious
dissensions; and Cameron excited the indignation of the more
strenuous adherents of his own party. He withdrew to the
neighbouring town of Moissac; but he soon returned to Montauban,
and a few days afterwards he died at the age of about
forty-six. Cameron left by his first wife several children, whose
maintenance was undertaken by the Protestant churches in
France. All his works were published after his death.</p>

<p>His name has a distinct place in the development of Calvinistic
theology in Europe. He and his followers maintained that the
will of man is determined by the practical judgment of the
mind; that the cause of men&rsquo;s doing good or evil proceeds from
the knowledge which God infuses into them; and that God does
not move the will physically, but only morally, by virtue of its
dependence on the judgment of the mind. This peculiar doctrine
of grace and free-will was adopted by Amyraut, Cappel, Bochart,
Daill√© and others of the more learned among the Reformed
ministers, who dissented from Calvin&rsquo;s. The Cameronites (not
to be confused with the Scottish sect called Cameronians)
are moderate Calvinists, and approach to the opinion of the
Arminians. They are also called Universalists, as holding the
universal reference of Christ&rsquo;s death, and sometimes Amyraldists.
The rigid adherents to the synod of Dort accused them
of Pelagianism, and even of Manichaeism, and the controversy
between the parties was carried on with great zeal; yet the
whole question between them was only, whether the will of man
is determined by the immediate action of God upon it, or by
the intervention of a knowledge which God impresses on the
mind.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMERON, RICHARD<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> (1648?-1680), founder of a Scottish
religious sect of Cameronians, which formed the nucleus of
the regiment of this name in the British army, was born at
Falkland in the county of Fife. He was educated at the village
school, and his success was so great that, while still a youth,
he was appointed schoolmaster. In this situation he became
acquainted with some of the more enthusiastic field-preachers.
Persuaded by them he resigned his post and entered the family
of Sir Walter Scott of Harden as chaplain and tutor. Refusing
to acknowledge the Indulgence, he joined the ranks of the non-conforming
ministers, and incited the inhabitants of the southern
counties of Scotland to protest openly against the new edict.
So formidable was the agitation that the government pronounced
illegal all armed assemblages for religious purposes. Cameron
took refuge in Holland, where he resided for some time; but
in the autumn of 1679 (probably) he returned to Scotland, and
once more made himself formidable to the government. Shortly
after the defeat of the Covenanters at Bothwell Bridge in that
year, Cameron was slain in a skirmish at the Aird&rsquo;s, or Airs,
Moss, fighting bravely at the head of the few troops which he
had been able to collect. His prayer before going into battle
became a tradition&mdash;&ldquo;Lord spare the green and take the ripe.&rdquo;
After the accession of William III. the survivors were amnestied,
and the Cameronian regiment was formed from them.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMERON, SIMON<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> (1799-1889), American politician, was
born in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, on the 8th of March
1799. Left an orphan at the age of nine, he early entered
journalism, and, in banking and railway enterprises, accumulated
a considerable fortune. He became influential in Pennsylvania
politics, and in 1845-1849 served in the United States Senate,
being elected by a combination of Democratic, Whig and
&ldquo;American&rdquo; votes to succeed James Buchanan. In 1854,
having failed to secure the nomination for senator from the
&ldquo;Know-Nothing&rdquo; Party, which he had recently joined, he
became a leader of the &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Party,&rdquo; as the Republican
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>109</span>
Party was at first called in Pennsylvania. In 1857 he was
elected to the United States Senate as a Republican, despite a
Democratic majority in the state legislature, a fact that gave
rise to charges of bribery. His prominence as a candidate first
for the presidential and then for the vice-presidential nomination
in the Republican national convention of 1860 led to his being
selected by President Lincoln as secretary of war. His administration
of this office at a critical time was marked by his accustomed
energy, but unfortunately also by partiality in the letting
of government contracts, which brought about his resignation
at Lincoln&rsquo;s request in January 1862 and his subsequent censure
by the House of Representatives. Lincoln sent him as minister
to Russia, but he returned in November 1862. He again served
in the Senate (after 1872, being chairman of the committee on
foreign relations) from 1867 until 1877, when he resigned to
make room for his son, whose election he dictated. Cameron
was one of the ablest political organizers the United States has
ever known, and his long undisputed control of Pennsylvania
politics was one of the most striking examples of &ldquo;boss rule&rdquo;
in American history. The definition of an honest politician as
&ldquo;one who when he is bought will stay bought&rdquo; has been
attributed to him. He died on the 26th of June 1889.</p>

<p>His son <span class="sc">James Donald Cameron</span> (1833-&emsp;&emsp;) was born at
Middletown, Pennsylvania, on the 14th of May 1833, graduated
at Princeton in 1852, became actively interested in his father&rsquo;s
banking and railway enterprises, and from 1863 to 1874 was
president of the Northern Central railway. Trained in the
political school of his father, he developed into an astute politician.
From June 1876 to March 1877 he was secretary of war in
President Grant&rsquo;s cabinet. In the Republican national convention
of 1876 he took an influential part in preventing the nomination
of James G. Elaine, and later was one of those who directed
the policy of the Republicans in the struggle for the presidency
between Tilden and Hayes. From 1877 until 1897 he was a
member of the United States Senate, having been elected
originally to succeed his father, who resigned in order to create
the vacancy. He was chairman of the Republican national
committee during the campaign of 1880.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMERON, VERNEY LOVETT<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> (1844-1894), English traveller
in Central Africa, was born at Radipole, near Weymouth, Dorsetshire,
on the 1st of July 1844. He entered the navy in 1857,
served in the Abyssinian campaign of 1868, and was employed
for a considerable time in the suppression of the East African
slave trade. The experience thus obtained led to his being
selected to command an expedition sent by the Royal Geographical
Society in 1873, to succour Dr. Livingstone. He was also
instructed to make independent explorations, guided by Livingstone&rsquo;s
advice. Soon after the departure of the expedition from
Zanzibar, Livingstone&rsquo;s servants were met bearing the dead
body of their master. Cameron&rsquo;s two European companions
turned back, but he continued his march and reached Ujiji,
on Lake Tanganyika, in February 1874, where he found and
sent to England Livingstone&rsquo;s papers. Cameron spent some time
determining the true form of the south part of the lake, and
solved the question of its outlet by the discovery of the Lukuga
river. From Tanganyika he struck westward to Nyangwe,
the Arab town on the Lualaba previously visited by Livingstone.
This river Cameron rightly believed to be the main stream of
the Congo, and he endeavoured to procure canoes to follow
it down. In this he was unsuccessful, owing to his refusal to
countenance slavery, and he therefore turned south-west.
After tracing the Congo-Zambezi watershed for hundreds of
miles he reached Bihe and finally arrived at the coast on the
28th of November 1875, being the first European to cress
Equatorial Africa from sea to sea. His travels, which were
published in 1877 under the title <i>Across Africa</i>, contain valuable
suggestions for the opening up of the continent, including the
utilization of the great lakes as a &ldquo;Cape to Cairo&rdquo; connexion.
In recognition of his work he was promoted to the rank of
commander, made a Companion of the Bath and given the gold
medal of the Geographical Society. The remainder of Cameron&rsquo;s
life was chiefly devoted to projects for the commercial development
of Africa, and to writing tales for the young. He visited
the Euphrates valley in 1878-1879 in connexion with a proposed
railway to the Persian Gulf, and accompanied Sir Richard
Burton in his West African journey of 1882. At the Gold Coast
Cameron surveyed the Tarkwa region, and he was joint author
with Burton of <i>To the Gold Coast for Gold</i> (1883). He was killed,
near Leighton Buzzard, by a fall from horseback when returning
from hunting, on the 24th of March 1894.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A second edition of <i>Across Africa</i>, with new matter and corrected
maps, appeared in 1885. A summary of Cameron&rsquo;s great journey,
from his own pen, appears in Dr Robert Brown&rsquo;s <i>The Story of Africa</i>,
vol. ii. pp. 266-279 (London, 1893).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMERON OF LOCHIEL, SIR EWEN<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (1629-1719), Scottish
Highland chieftain, was the eldest son of John Cameron and the
grandson of Alan Cameron, the head of the clan Cameron.
Having lost his father in infancy he passed part of his youth with
the marquess of Argyll at Inveraray, leaving his guardian about
1647 to take up his duties as chief of the clan Cameron, a position
in which he succeeded his grandfather. In 1653 Lochiel joined
the earl of Glencairn in his rising on behalf of Charles II., and
after the defeat of this attempt he served the Royalist cause by
harassing General Monk. In 1681 he was knighted by Charles II.,
and in July 1689 he was with Viscount Dundee at Killiecrankie.
He was too old to share personally in the Jacobite rising of 1715,
but his sympathies were with the Stuarts, and his son led the
Camerons at Sheriffmuir. Lochiel, who died in February 1719,
is called by Macaulay the &ldquo;Ulysses of the Highlands.&rdquo; He was a
man of enormous strength and size, and one who met him in 1716
says &ldquo;he wrung some blood from the point of my fingers with a
grasp of his hand.&rdquo; An incident showing his strength and
ferocity in single combat is used by Sir Walter Scott in <i>The Lady
of the Lake</i> (canto v.). Lochiel&rsquo;s son and successor, John, who
was attainted for sharing in the rebellion of 1715, died in Flanders
in 1748. John&rsquo;s son Donald, sometimes called &ldquo;gentle Lochiel,&rdquo;
joined Charles Edward, the Young Pretender, in 1745, was
wounded at Culloden, and escaped to France, dying in the same
year as his father. The 79th regiment, or Cameron Highlanders,
was raised from among the members of the clan in 1793 by Sir
Alan Cameron (1753-1828).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMERONIANS,<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> the name given to that section of the Scottish
Covenanters (<i>q.v.</i>) who followed Richard Cameron (<i>q.v.</i>), and
who were chiefly found among those who signed the Sanquhar
Declaration in 1680. Known also as &ldquo;Society Men,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sanquharians&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Hillmen,&rdquo; they became a separate church
after the religious settlement of 1690, taking the official title
of Reformed Presbyterians in 1743. Societies of Cameronians
for the maintenance of the Presbyterian form of worship were
formed about 1681; their testimony, &ldquo;The Informatory Vindication,&rdquo;
is dated 1687; and they quickly became the most pronounced
and active adherents of the covenanting faith. Holding
fast to the two covenants, the National Covenant of 1580 and
the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643, they wished to restore
the ecclesiastical order which had existed between 1638 and 1649,
and were dissatisfied with the moderate character of the religious
settlement of 1690. Refusing to take the oaths of allegiance to
an &ldquo;uncovenanted&rdquo; ruler, or to exercise any civil function, they
passed through a period of trial and found some difficulty in
maintaining a regular ministry; but in 1706 they were reinforced
by some converts from the established church. They objected
strongly to the proposal for the union of England and Scotland,
and were suspected of abetting a rising which took place in the
west of Scotland in 1706; but there appears to be no foundation
for the statement that they intrigued with the Jacobites, and
they gave no trouble to the government either in 1715 or in 1745.
In 1712 they publicly renewed the covenants at Auchensauch
Hill in Lanarkshire, and in 1743 their first presbytery was
constituted at Braehead, while a presbytery was formed in North
America in 1774. In 1863 the Cameronians, or Reformed
Presbyterians, decided to inflict no penalties upon those members
who had taken the oaths, or had exercised civil functions, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
consequently a few congregations seceded. In 1876 the general
body of the Reformed Presbyterians united with the Free Church
of Scotland, leaving the few seceding congregations as the
representatives of the principles of the Cameronians. In the
British army the first battalion of the Cameronians (Scottish
Rifles) is directly descended from the &ldquo;Cameronian guard,&rdquo;
which, composed of Cameronians, was embodied by the convention
parliament in 1689, and was afterwards employed to
restore order in the Highlands.</p>

distance on the south where it is conterminous with the Spanish

<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:675px; height:855px" src="images/img110.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr></table>

<p><i>Boundaries and Area.</i>&mdash;The sea frontier extends from the Rio
del Rey, just where the great bend of the coast-line east to south
begins, forming the Bight of Biafra, to the Campo river, a distance
of 200 m. The north-western boundary, laid down in an
agreement between Germany and Great Britain on the 15th of
November 1893, runs from the mouth of the Rio del Rey to the
&ldquo;rapids&rdquo; of the Cross river in 8¬∞ 48&prime; E. Thence it is continued
in a north-east line towards Yola, as far as the confines of that
town. The boundary is then deflected south so as to leave
Yola in British territory, turning north again to cross the Benue
river at a spot 3 m. west of where the Faro joins the Benue.
From this point the frontier goes north-east to the border of
Lake Chad, 35 m. east of the meridian of the town of Kuka.
The southern shores of Lake Chad for a distance of some 40 m.
belong to the protectorate. The south and east boundaries
were laid down by agreements between Germany and France on
the 24th of December 1885, the 15th of March 1894 and the
18th of April 1908. The south boundary runs in a fairly direct
line from the mouth of the Campo river to the river Dscha (or
Ngoko), which it follows to its confluence with the Sanga. The
eastern boundary runs from the Sanga irregularly north to 10¬∞ N.,
where it approaches the British frontier at Yola, so that at its
narrowest part the protectorate is little more than 50 m. across.
From 10¬∞ N. the frontier turns eastwards to
the Logone, thence going north-east to the
Shari river, which it follows to Lake Chad.
The protectorate has an area of about 190,000
sq. m. Estimated population (1908) 3,500,000,
of whom 1128 were whites.</p>

<p><i>Origin of the Name.</i>&mdash;The name Camar√µes was
first given by the Portuguese discoverers of
the 15th and 16th centuries to a large bay or
estuary, lying south-east of a great mountain
close to the sea, met with after passing the
Niger delta. This estuary they called the Rio
dos Camar√µes (the river of Prawns), from the
abundance of the crustacea found therein.
The name Camar√µes was also used to designate
the neighbouring mountains. The English
usage until nearly the end of the 19th century
was to confine the term &ldquo;the Cameroons&rdquo; to
the mountain range, and to speak of the
estuary as the Cameroons river. Locally it was
often called &ldquo;the Bay.&rdquo; On their acquisition
of the country in 1884 the Germans extended
the use of the name in its Teutonic form&mdash;
Kamerun&mdash;to the whole protectorate.</p>

<p><i>Physical Features.</i>&mdash;Cameroon forms the
north-west corner of the great Central African
plateau. This becomes evident in its eastern
section, where are wide-spreading plains, which
farther west assume an undulating character,
and gradually merge into a picturesque mountain
range. This range, running from north
to south, is flanked by a parallel and lower
range in the west, with a wide valley between.
In the north-west the Upper Guinea mountains
send their eastern spurs across the boundary,
and from a volcanic rift, which runs south-west
to north-east, the Cameroon peak towers
up, its summit 13,370 ft. high. This mountain,
whose south-western base is washed by the
Atlantic, is the highest point on the western
side of Africa, and it alone of the great mountains
of the continent lies close to the coast.
From any vantage point, but especially from
the sea, it presents a magnificent spectacle,
while some 30 m. westward rises Clarence peak, the culminating
point of Fernando Po. With an area, on an isolated base, of
700 to 800 sq. m., Cameroon mountain has but two distinct
peaks, Great Cameroon and Little Cameroon (5820 ft.), which
is from foot to top covered with dense forest. The native
designation of the highest peak is Mongo-ma-Loba, or the
Mountain of Thunder, and the whole upper region is usually
called Mongo-mo-Ndemi, or the Mountain of Greatness. On the
principal summit there are a group of craters. In 1909 the
mountain was in eruption and huge streams of lava were
ejected. Inland the Chebchi and Mandara mountains indicate
the direction and extent of the rift.</p>

<p>The mountains of the plateau sweep grandly round to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span>
east on reaching the eighth degree of N. lat. Here they give
rise to a number of small rivers, which collect in the rift and
form the Benue, the great eastern affluent of the Niger. This
part of the protectorate is known as Adamawa (<i>q.v.</i>). Farther
north, beyond the Mandara mountains, the country, here part
of the ancient sultanate of Bornu, slopes to the shores of Lake
Chad, and has a general level of 800 to 1000 ft. The greater part
of Cameroon is thus a mountainous country, with, on the coast,
a strip of low land. In the south this is very narrow; it widens towards
the north savewhere the Cameroon peak reaches to the sea.</p>

<p>At the foot of the Cameroon peak a number of estuaries cut
deep bays which form excellent harbours. The small rivers
which empty into them can be ascended for some miles by steam
launches. The principal estuary, which is over 20 m. wide, is
called, as already noted, the Cameroon river or bay. The term
river is more particularly confined to a ramification of the estuary
which receives the waters of the Mungo river (a considerable
stream which flows south from the Cameroon mountains), the
Wuri, a river coming from the north-east, and various smaller
rivers. Under the shadow of Cameroon peak lies the bay of
Ambas, with the islands of Ndami (Ambas) and Mondola. It
forms a tolerable harbour, capable of receiving large vessels.</p>

<p>Traversing the central portion of the country is a large river
known in its upper course as the Lom, and in its lower as the
Sanaga, which enters the ocean just to the south of the Cameroon
estuary. Both the Lom and the Nyong (a more southerly
stream) rise in the central plateau, from which they descend in
splendid cascades, breaking through the parallel coast range in
rapids, which indicate the extent of their navigability. The
Lokunja and Kribi are smaller rivers with courses parallel to
and south of the Nyong. In the south-east of the colony the
streams&mdash;of which the chief are the Dscha and Bumba&mdash;are
tributaries of the Sanga, itself an affluent of the Congo (<i>q.v.</i>).
About 100 m. of the right bank of the Sanga, from the confluence
of the Dscha upwards, are in German territory. In the north
the country drains into Lake Chad through the Logone and
Shari (<i>q.v.</i>). Including the headwaters of the Benue the colony
has four distinct river-systems, one connecting with the Niger,
another with the Congo, and a third with Lake Chad, the fourth
being the rivers which run direct to the sea. The Niger and
Shari systems communicate, with, at high water, but one obstruction
to navigation. The connecting link is a marshy lake named
Tuburi. From it issues the Kebbi (Mao Kebi) a tributary of
the Benue, and through it flows a tributary of the Logone, the
chief affluent of the Shari. The one obstruction in the waterway
is a fall of 165 ft. in the Kebbi.</p>

<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The oldest rocks, forming the greater mass of the
hinterland, are gneisses, schists and granites of Archaean age.
Along the Benue river a sandstone (Benue sandstone) forms the
banks to 14¬∞ E. Cretaceous rocks occur around the basalt
platform of the Cameroon mountain and generally along the
coastal belt. Basalt and tuff, probably of Tertiary age, form
the great mass of the Cameroon mountain, also the island of
Fernando Po. Extensive areas in the interior, more especially
towards Lake Chad, are covered with black earth of alluvial or
lacustrine origin.</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The country lies wholly within the tropics and has
a characteristic tropical climate. In the interior four seasons
can be distinguished; a comparatively dry and a wet one alternating.
July to October are the coldest months, and also bring
most rain, but there is hardly a month without rain. On the
coast the temperature is high all the year round, but on the
plateau it is cooler. Malarial fever is frequent, and even the
Africans, especially those coming from other countries, suffer from
it. The middle zone of the Cameroon mountain has, however, a
temperate climate and affords excellent sites for sanatoria.</p>

<p><i>Flora and Fauna.</i>&mdash;The southern part of the low coast is
chiefly grass land, while the river mouths and arms of the bays
are lined with mangroves. The mountainous region is covered
with primeval forest, in which timber and valuable woods for
cabinet-making are plentiful. Most important are the <i>Elaeis
guineensis, Sterculia acuminata</i> and the wild coffee tree. On
Cameroon peak the forest ascends to 8000 ft.; above it is grass
land. Towards the east the forest gradually grows thinner,
assumes a park-like appearance, and finally disappears, wide
grass uplands taking its place. The country north of the Benue
is rich and well cultivated. Cotton and rubber are found in
considerable quantities, and fields of maize, corn, rice and sugarcane
bear witness to the fertility of the soil.</p>

<p>Animals are plentiful, including the great pachyderms and
carnivora. The latter prey on the various kinds of antelopes
which swarm on the grass lands. Two kinds of buffaloes are
found in the forests, which are the home of the gorilla and
chimpanzee. Large rodents, like the porcupine and cane rat,
are numerous. Of birds there are 316 species, and several of
venomous snakes.</p>

<p><i>Inhabitants.</i>&mdash;The north of Cameroon is inhabited by Fula
(<i>q.v.</i>) and Hausa (<i>q.v.</i>) and allied tribes, the south by Bantu-speaking
races. The Fula came from the north and north-east,
gradually driving the Bantu-negroes before them. They brought
horses and horned cattle, unknown in these regions until then,
and they founded well-organized states, like that of Adamawa,
now divided between Cameroon and the British protectorate
of Nigeria. In the vicinity of the rivers Benue, Faro and Kebbi,
the people, who are good agriculturists, raise cereals and other
crops, while on the plateaus stock-raising forms the chief pursuit
of the inhabitants. In this northern region villages are built
in the Sudanese zeriba style, surrounded with thorn fences;
more important places are enclosed by a well-built wall and
strongly fortified. Of martial disposition, the people often
waged war with their neighbours, and also amongst themselves
until the pacification of the hinterland by Germany at the
beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The Bantu-negroes inhabit the country south of about 7¬∞ N.
Chief among the tribes are the Dualla (<i>q.v.</i>), the Ba-kwiri (<i>q.v.</i>),
the Ba-Long, the Ba-Farami, the Wuri, the Abo and the Ba-Kundu.
They build square houses, are active traders and are
ruled by independent chiefs, having no political cohesion.
Among the Dualla a curious system of drum signals is noteworthy.
In the coast towns are numbers of Krumen, who,
however, rarely settle permanently in the country. The Fula,
as also most of the Hausa, are Moslems, the other tribes are
pagans. Missionary societies, both Protestant and Roman
Catholic, are represented in the colony, and their schools are
well attended, as are the schools belonging to the government.
In all the schools German is taught, but pidgin-English is largely
spoken at the coast towns.</p>

<p><i>Chief Towns.</i>&mdash;Duala, the chief town in the protectorate, is
situated on the Cameroon estuary at the mouth of the Wuri
river in 4¬∞ 2&prime; N. 9¬∞ 42&prime; E. It consists of various trading stations
and native towns close to one another on the south bank of the
river and known, before the German occupation, as Cameroon,
Bell town, Akwa town, &amp;c. Hickory, on the north side of the
stream and the starting point of the railway to the interior, is
also part of Duala, which has a total population of 22,000, including
about 170 Europeans. Duala is the headquarters of the
merchants and missionaries. The principal streets are wide
and tree lined, the sanitation is good. The government offices
are placed in a fine park in which are statues of Gustav Nachtigal
and others. The port is provided with a floating dock. The
seat of government is Buea, a post 3000 ft. above the sea on the
slopes of the Cameroon mountain. Victoria is a flourishing
town in Ambas Bay, founded by the British Baptist missionaries
expelled from Fernando Po in 1858 (see below). Batanga and
Campo are trading stations in the southern portion of the colony.
On the route from Duala to Lake Chad is the large commercial
town of Ngaundere, inhabited chiefly by Hausas and occupied
by the Germans in 1901. Another large town is Garua on the
Benue river. Farther north and within 30 m. of Lake Chad is
Dikwa (Dikoa), in Bornu, the town chosen by Rabah (<i>q.v.</i>) as his
capital after his conquest of Bornu. Gulfei on the lower Shari
and Kusseri on the Logone are also towns of some note. Ngoko
is a trading station on the Dscha, in the south-east of the protectorate,
near the confluence of that river with the Sanga.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span></p>

<p><i>Products and Industry.</i>&mdash;Cameroon is rich in natural products,
one of the most important being the oil-palm. Cocoa cultivation
was introduced by the Germans and proved remarkably successful.
Rubber is collected from the Landolphia and various
species of Ficus. Palm-oil, palm kernels, cocoa, copal, copra,
Calabar beans, kola-nuts and ivory are the principal exports.
There are several kinds of finely-grained wood, amongst which
a very dark ebony is specially remarkable. Cotton, indigo and
various fibres of plants deserve notice. The natives grow several
kinds of bananas, yams and batatas, maize, pea-nuts, sugar-cane,
sorghum and pepper. Minerals have not been found in paying
quantities. Iron is smelted by the natives, who, especially
amongst the Hausas, are very clever smiths, and manufacture
fine lances and arrow heads, knives and swords, and also hoes.
Dikwa is the centre of an important trade of which the chief
articles are coffee, sugar, velvet, silk and weapons, as well as gold
and silver objects  brought by caravans from Tripoli. The
natives round the Cameroon estuary are clever carvers of wood,
and make highly ornamental figure heads for their canoes, which
also sometimes show very fine workmanship. In the interior
the people use the wild-growing cotton and fibres of plants to
manufacture coarse drapery and plait-work. Plantations
founded  by German industry are fairly successful. Large
reserves are set apart for the natives by government when
marking off the land granted to plantation companies. The
best-known of these  companies, the <i>S√ºd-Kamerun,</i> holds a
concession over a large tract of country by the Sanga river,
exporting its rubber, ivory and other produce via the Congo.
The principal imports are cotton goods, spirits, building material,
firearms, hardware and salt. The annual value of the external
trade in the period 1900-1905 averaged about ¬£800,000. In 1907
the value of the trade had increased to ¬£1,700,000. Some 70%
of the import and export trade was with Germany, the remainder
being almost entirely with Great Britain. The percentage of the
trade with Germany was increasing, that with Britain decreasing.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;There is regular steamship communication
with Europe by German and British boats. On the rivers which
run into the Cameroon estuary small steam launches ply. The
protectorate belongs to the Postal Union, and is connected by cable
with the British telegraph station at Bonny in the Niger delta.</p>

<p>An imperial guarantee of interest was obtained in 1905 for
the construction of a railway from Hickory to Bayong, a place
100 m. to the north, the district traversed being fertile and
populous. From Victoria a line runs to Soppo (22 m.) near
Buea and is continued thence northward. Another line, sanctioned
in 1908, runs S.E. from Duala to the upper waters of the
Nyong. In the neighbourhood of government stations excellent
roads have been built. The chief towns in the coast region are
connected by telegraph and telephone.</p>

<p><i>Government Revenue, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The administration is under the
direction of a governor appointed by and responsible to the
imperial authorities. The governor is assisted by a chancellor
and other officials and an advisory council whose members are
merchants resident in the protectorate. Decrees having the
force of law are issued by the imperial chancellor on the advice
of the governor. In Adamawa and German Bornu are various
Mahommedan sultanates controlled by residents stationed at
Garua and Kusseri. Revenue is raised chiefly by customs dues
on spirits and tobacco and a general 10% <i>ad valorem</i> duty on
most goods. A poll tax is imposed on the natives. The local
revenue (¬£131,000 in 1905) is supplemented by an imperial grant,
the protectorate in the first twenty-one years of its existence
never having raised sufficient revenue to meet its expenditure,
which in 1905 exceeded ¬£230,000. Order is maintained by a
native force officered by Germans.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Cameroon and the neighbouring coast were discovered
by the Portuguese navigator, Fernando Po, towards the
close of the 15th century. They were formerly regarded as within
the Oil Rivers district, sometimes spoken of as the Oil Coast.
Trading settlements were established by Europeans as early as
the 17th century. The trade was confined to the coast, the
Dualla and other tribes being recognized intermediaries between
the coast &ldquo;factories&rdquo; and the tribes in the interior, whither
they allowed no strange trader to proceed. They took a quantity
of goods on trust, visited the tribes in the forest, and bartered
for ivory, rubber and other produce. This method of trade,
called the trust system, worked well, but when the country came
under the administration of Germany, the system broke down,
as inland traders were allowed to visit the coast. Before this
happened the &ldquo;kings&rdquo; of the chief trading stations&mdash;Akwa and
Bell&mdash;were wealthy merchant princes. From the beginning
until near the end of the 19th century they were very largely
under British influence. In 1837 the king of Bimbia, a district
on the mainland on the north of the estuary, made over a large
part of the country round the bay to Great Britain. In 1845, at
which time there was a flourishing trade in slaves between
Cameroon and America, the Baptist Missionary Society made
its first settlement on the mainland of Africa, Alfred Saker
(1814-1880) obtaining from the Akwa family the site for a
mission station. In 1848 another mission station was established
at Bimbia, the king agreeing to abolish human sacrifices
at the funerals of his great men. Into the Cameroon
country Saker and his colleagues introduced the elements
of civilization, and with the help of British men-of-war
the oversea slave trade was finally stopped (<i>c.</i> 1875). The
struggles between the Bell (Mbeli) and Akwa families were also
largely composed. In 1858, on the expulsion of the Baptists
from Fernando Po (<i>q.v.</i>), Saker founded at Ambas Bay a colony
of the freed negroes who then left the island, the settlement
being known as Victoria. Two years after this event the first
German factory was established in the estuary by Messrs Woermann
of Hamburg. In 1870 the station at Bimbia was given up
by the missionaries, but that at Akwa town continued to flourish,
the Dualla showing themselves eager to acquire education, while
Saker reduced their language to writing. He left Cameroon in
1876, the year before George Grenfell, afterwards famous for
his work on the Congo, came to the country, where he remained
three years. Like the earlier missionaries he explored the
adjacent districts, discovering the Sanaga in its lower course.
Although British influence was powerful and the British consul
for the Oil Rivers during this period exercised considerable
authority over the native chiefs, requests made by them&mdash;in
particular by the Dualla chiefs in 1882&mdash;for annexation by Great
Britain, were refused or neglected, with the result that when
Germany started on her quest to pick up unappropriated parts
of the African coast she was enabled to secure Cameroon. A
treaty with King Bell was negotiated by Dr Gustav Nachtigal,
the signature of the king and the other chiefs being obtained at
midnight on the 15th of July 1884. Five days later Mr E.H.
Hewett, British consul, arrived with a mission to annex the
country to Great Britain.<a name="fa2i" id="fa2i" href="#ft2i"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Though too late to secure King Bell&rsquo;s
territory, Mr Hewett concluded treaties with all the neighbouring
chiefs, but the British government decided to recognize the
German claim not only to Bell town, but to the whole Cameroon
region. Some of the tribes, disappointed at not being taken over
by Great Britain, refused to acknowledge German sovereignty.
Their villages were bombarded and they were reduced to submission.
The settlement of the English Baptists at Victoria,
Ambas Bay, was at first excluded from the German protectorate,
but in March 1887 an arrangement was made by which, while
the private rights of the missionaries were maintained, the
sovereignty of the settlement passed to Germany. The Baptist
Society thereafter made over its missions, both at Ambas Bay
and in the estuary, to the Basel Society.</p>

<p>The extension of German influence in the interior was gradually
accomplished, though not without considerable bloodshed. That
part of Adamawa recognized as outside the British frontier was
occupied in 1901 after somewhat severe fighting. In 1902 the
imperial troops first penetrated into that part of Bornu reserved
to Germany by agreements with Great Britain and France.
They found the country in the military occupation of France.
The French officers, who stated that their presence was due to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
the measures rendered necessary by the ravages of Rabah and
his sons, withdrew their troops into French territory. The shores
of Lake Chad were first reached by a German military force on
the 2nd of May 1902. In 1904 and again in 1905 there were
native risings in various parts of the protectorate. These
disturbances were followed, early in 1906, by the recall of the
governor, Herr von Puttkamer, who was called upon to answer
charges of maladministration. He was succeeded in 1907 by Dr
T. Seitz. Collisions on the southern border of the protectorate
between French and German troops led in 1905-1906 to an
accurate survey of the south and east frontier regions and to a
new convention (1908) whereby for the straight lines marking
the frontier in former agreements natural features were largely
substituted. Germany gained a better outlet to the Sanga river.</p>

<p>The ascent of the Cameroon mountain was first attempted by
Joseph Merrick of the Baptist Missionary Society in 1847; but it
was not till 1861 that the summit was gained, when the ascent
was made by Sir Richard Burton, Gustav Mann, a noted botanist,
and Se√±or Calvo. The starting-point was Babundi, a place on the
seashore west of the mountain. From the south-east the summit
was reached by Mary Kingsley in 1895.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMILLUS, MARCUS FURIUS,<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> Roman soldier and statesman,
of patrician descent, censor in 403 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> He triumphed four
times, was five times dictator, and was honoured with the title
of Second Founder of Rome. When accused of having unfairly
distributed the spoil taken at Veii, which was captured by him
after a ten years&rsquo; siege, he went into voluntary exile at Ardea.
The real cause of complaint against him was no doubt his
patrician haughtiness and his triumphal entry into Rome in a
chariot drawn by white horses. Subsequently the Romans,
when besieged in the Capitol by the Gauls, created him dictator;
he completely defeated the enemy (but see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brennus</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rome</a></span>:
<i>History</i>, ii., &ldquo;The Republic&rdquo;) and drove them from Roman
territory. He dissuaded the Romans, disheartened by the
devastation wrought by the Gauls, from migrating to Veii, and
induced them to rebuild the city. He afterwards fought successfully
against the Aequi, Volsci and Etruscans, and repelled a fresh
invasion of the Gauls in 367. Though patrician in sympathy,
he saw the necessity of making concessions to the plebeians
and was instrumental in passing the Licinian laws. He died of
the plague in the eighty-first year of his age (365). The story of
Camillus is no doubt largely traditional. To this element probably
belongs the story of the schoolmaster who, when Camillas
was attacking Falerii (<i>q.v.</i>), attempted to betray the town by
bringing into his camp the sons of some of the principal inhabitants
of the place. Camillus, it is said, had him whipped back
into the town by his pupils, and the Faliscans were so affected
by this generosity that they at once surrendered.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMILLUS<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> and <b>CAMILLA,</b> in Roman antiquity, originally
terms used for freeborn children. Later, they were used to
denote the attendants on certain priests and priestesses, especially
the flamen dialis and flaminica and the curiones. It was necessary
that they should be freeborn and the children of parents
still alive (Dion. Halic. ii. 21). The name Camillus has been
connected with the Cadmilus or Casmilus of the Samothracian
mysteries, identified with Hermes (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cabeiri</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CAMISARDS<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> (from <i>camisade</i>, obsolete Fr. for &ldquo;a night attack,&rdquo;
from the Ital. <i>camiciata</i>, formed from <i>camicia</i>&mdash;Fr. <i>chemise</i>&mdash;a
shirt, from the fact of a shirt being worn over the armour in
order to distinguish friends from foes), the name given to the
peasantry of the C√©vennes who, from 1702 to 1705 and for some
years afterwards, carried on an organized military resistance to
the <i>dragonnades</i>, or conversion by torture, death and confiscation
of property, by which, in the Huguenot districts of France, the
revocation of the edict of Nantes was attempted to be enforced.
The Camisards were also called Barbets (&ldquo;water-dogs,&rdquo; a term
also applied to the Waldenses), Vagabonds, Assemblers (<i>assembl√©e</i>
was the name given to the meeting or conventicle of Huguenots),
Fanatics and the Children of God. They belonged to that
romance-speaking people of Gothic descent whose mystic
imagination and independent character made the south of
France the most fertile nursing-ground of medieval heresy (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cathars</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Albigenses</a></span>). At the time of the Reformation
the same causes produced like results. Calvin was warmly
welcomed when he preached at N√Æmes; Montpellier became the
chief centre for the instruction of the Huguenot youth. It was,
however, in the great triangular plateau of mountain called the
C√©vennes that, among the small farmers, the cloth and silk
weavers and vine dressers, Protestantism was most intense and
universal. These people were (and still are) very poor, but
intelligent and pious, and of a character at once grave and fervent.
From the lists of Huguenots sent from Languedoc to the galleys
(1684 to 1762), we gather that the common type of <i>physique</i> is
&ldquo;belle taille, cheveux bruns, visage ovale.&rdquo; The chief theatre
of the revolt comprised that region of the C√©vennes bounded by
the towns of Florac, Pont-de-Montvert, Alais and Lasalle, thus
embracing the southern portion of the department of Loz√®re
(the Bas-G√©vaudan) and the neighbouring district in the east
of the department of Gard.</p>

<p>In order to understand the War of the C√©vennes it is necessary
to recall the persecutions which preceded and followed the
revocation of the edict of Nantes. It is also necessary to
remember the extraordinary religious movement which had for a
great number of years agitated the Protestants of France.
Faced by the violation of that most solemn of treaties, a treaty
which had been declared perpetual and irrevocable by Henry IV.,
Louis XIII. and even Louis XIV. himself, they could not, in
the enthusiasm of their faith, believe that such a crime would
be left unpunished. But being convinced that no human power
could give them liberty of conscience, they went to the Bible
to find when their deliverance would come. As far back as
1686 Pierre Jurieu published his work <i>L&rsquo;Accomplissement des
proph√©ties</i>, in which, speaking of the Apocalypse, he predicted
the end of the persecution and the fall of Babylon&mdash;that is
to say of Roman Catholicism&mdash;for 1689. The Revolution in
England seemed to provide a striking corroboration of his
prophecies, and the apocalyptic enthusiasm took so strong a
hold on people&rsquo;s minds that Bossuet felt compelled to refute
Jurieu&rsquo;s arguments in his <i>Apocalypse expliqu√©e</i>, published in
1689. The <i>Lettres pastorales</i> of Jurieu (Rotterdam, 1686-1687),
a series of brief tracts which were secretly circulated in France,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
continued to narrate events and prodigies in which the author
saw the intervention of God, and thus strengthened the courage
of his adherents. This religious enthusiasm, under the influence
of Du Serre, was manifested for the first time in the Dauphin√©.
Du Serre, who was a pupil of Jurieu, communicated his mystic
faith to young children who were called the &ldquo;petits proph√®tes,&rdquo;
the most famous of whom was a girl named &ldquo;La belle Isabeau.&rdquo;
Brought up on the study of the prophets and the Apocalypse,
these children went from village to village quoting and requoting
the  most obscure and terrible passages from these ancient
prophecies (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Antichrist</a></span>). It is necessary to remember that
at this time the Protestants were without ministers, all being in
exile, and were thus deprived of all real religious instruction. They
listened with enthusiasm to this strange preaching, and thousands
of those who were called New Catholics were seen to be giving up
attendance at Mass. The movement advanced in Languedoc
with such rapidity that at one time there were more than three
hundred children shut up in the prisons of Uz√®s on the charge
of prophesying, and the Faculty of Medicine of Montpellier,
which was entrusted with their examination, went so far in
their ignorance as to pronounce these irresponsible infants
guilty of fanaticism. After the peace of Ryswick, 1697, the
fierceness of the persecution was redoubled in the South. &ldquo;I
will show no mercy to the preachers,&rdquo; wrote the terrible Baville,
the so-called &ldquo;king of Languedoc,&rdquo; and he kept his word. The
people of the C√©vennes were in despair, for their loyalty to the
king had been remarkable. In 1683 on the 6th of September
an assembly composed of fifty pastors, sixty-four noblemen and
thirty-four notables, held at Colognac, had drawn up a statement
of its unalterable loyalty to Louis XIV. It is important to notice
that the revolt of the C√©vennes was essentially a popular movement.
Among its leaders there was not a single nobleman, but
only men of the people, a baker, a blacksmith, some ex-soldiers;
but by far the most extraordinary characterisic is the presence,
no longer of children, but of men and women who declared
themselves inspired, who fell into religious ecstasies and roused in
their comrades the most heroic bravery in battle and at the stake.</p>

<p>The assassination of the abb√© du Chayla marks the beginning
of the war of the C√©vennes. The abb√©, a veteran Catholic
missionary from Siam, had been appointed inspector of missions
in the C√©vennes. There he introduced the &ldquo;squeezers&rdquo; (which
resembled the Scottish &ldquo;boot&rdquo;), and his systematic and refined
cruelty at last broke the patience of his victims. His murder, on
the 23rd of July 1702, at Pont de Monvert, was the first blow in
the war. It was planned by Esprit S√©guier, who at once began to
carry out his idea of a general massacre of the Catholic priests.
He soon fell, and was succeeded by Laporte, an old soldier, who,
as his troop increased, assumed the title of &ldquo;the Colonel of the
Children of God,&rdquo; and named his camp the &ldquo;Camp of the
Eternal.&rdquo; He used to lead his followers to the fight, singing
Clement Marot&rsquo;s grand version of the 68th Psalm, &ldquo;Que Dieu se
montre seulement,&rdquo; to the music of Goudimel. Besides Laporte,
the forest-ranger Castanet, the wool-carders Conderc and Mazel,
the soldiers Catinat, Joany and Ravenel were selected as captains&mdash;all
men whom the <i>th√©omanie</i> or prophetic malady had visited.
But the most important figures are those of Roland, who afterwards
issued the following extraordinary despatch to the inhabitants
of St Andr√©:&mdash;&ldquo;Nous, comte et seigneur Roland, g√©n√©ralissime
des Protestants de France, nous ordonnons que vous ayez √†
cong√©dier dans trois jours tous les pr√™tres et missionnaires qui sont
chez vous, sous peine d&rsquo;√™tre br√ªl√©s tout vifs, vous et eux&rdquo; (Court,
i.p. 219); and Jean Cavalier, the baker&rsquo;s boy, who, at the age of
seventeen, commanded the southern army of the Camisards, and
who, after defeating successively the comte de Broglie and three
French marshals, Montrevel, Berwick and Villars, made an
honourable peace. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cavalier, Jean</a></span>.)</p>

<p>Cavalier for nearly two years continued to direct the war.
Regular taxes were raised, arsenals were formed in the great
limestone caves of the district, the Catholic churches and their
decorations were burned and the clergy driven away. Occasionally
routed in regular engagements, the Camisards, through their
desperate valour and the rapidity of their movements, were
constantly successful in skirmishes, night attacks and ambuscades.
A force of 60,000 was now in the field against them; among
others, the Irish Brigade which had just returned from the
persecutions of the Waldenses. The rising was far from being
general, and never extended to more than three or four thousand
men, but it was rendered dangerous by the secret and even in
many places the open support of the people in general. On the
other hand their knowledge of a mountainous country clothed in
forests and without roads, gave the insurgents an enormous
advantage over the royal troops. The rebellion was not finally
suppressed until Baville had constructed roads throughout this
almost savage country.</p>

<p>Montrevel adopted a policy of extermination, and 466 villages
were burned in the Upper C√©vennes alone, the population being
for the most part put to the sword. Pope Clement XI. assisted
in this work by issuing a bull against the &ldquo;execrable race of the
ancient Albigenses,&rdquo; and promising remission of sins to the holy
militia which was now formed among the Catholic population,
and was called the Florentines, Cadets of the Cross or White
Camisards. Villars, the victor of Hochst√§dt and Friedlingen,
saw that conciliation was necessary; he took advantage of the
feeling of horror with which the quiet Protestants of Nimes and
other towns now regarded the war, and published an amnesty.
In May 1704 a formal meeting between Cavalier and Villars took
place at Nimes. The result of the interview was that a document
entitled <i>Tr√©s humble requ√™te des r√©form√©s du Languedoc au Roi</i> was
despatched to the court. The three leading requests for liberty
of conscience and the right of assembly outside walled towns, for
the liberation of those sentenced to prison or the galleys under the
revocation, and for the restitution to the emigrants of their
property and civil rights, were all granted,&mdash;the first on condition
of no churches being built, and the third on condition of an oath
of allegiance being taken. The greater part of the Camisard army
under Roland, Ravenel and Joany would not accept the terms
which Cavalier had arranged. They insisted that the edict of
Nantes must be restored,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>point de paix, que nous n&rsquo;ayons nos
temples</i>.&rdquo; They continued the war till January 1705, by which
time all their leaders were either killed or dispersed.</p>

<p>In 1709 Mazel and Claris, with the aid of two preaching women,
Marie Desubas and Elizabeth Catalon, made a serious effort to
rekindle revolt in the Vivarais. In 1711 all opposition and all
signs of the reformed religion had disappeared. On the 8th
of March 1715, by medals and a proclamation, Louis XIV.
announced the entire extinction of heresy.</p>

<p>What we know of the spiritual manifestations in the C√©vennes
(which much resembled those of the Swedish Raestars of Smaland
in 1844) is chiefly derived from <i>Le Th√©√¢tre sacr√© des C√©vennes</i>,
London, 1707, reprinted at Paris in 1847; <i>A Cry From the Desert</i>,
&amp;c., by John Lacy, London, 1707; <i>La Clef des proph√©ties de M.
Marion</i>, London, 1707; <i>Avertissements proph√©tiques d&rsquo;√âlie
Marion</i>, &amp;c., London, 1707. About the date of these publications
the three prophets of the C√©vennes, Marion, Durand-Fage and
Cavalier (a cousin of the famous Jean Cavalier) were in London
and were objects of lively curiosity. The consistory of the French
church in the Savoy sent a protest to the lord mayor against
&ldquo;cette secte impie et extravagante&rdquo; and the matter was tried at
the Guildhall. Misson, author of the <i>Th√©√¢tre sacr√©</i>, declared in
defence of the accused, that the same spirit which had caused
Balaam&rsquo;s ass to speak could speak through the mouths of these
prophets from the C√©vennes. Marion and his two friends Fatio,
a member of the Royal Society of London, and Daud√©, a leading
savant, who acted as his secretaries, were condemned to the
pillory and to the stocks. Voltaire relates (<i>Si√©cle de Louis XIV.</i>
c. 36) that Marion wished to prove his inspiration by attempting
to raise a dead body (Thomas Ernes) from St Paul&rsquo;s churchyard.
He was at last compelled to leave England.<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>The inspiration (of which there were four degrees, <i>avertissement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span>
souffle, prophetie, dons</i>) was sometimes communicated by a kiss at
the assembly. The patient, who had gone through several fasts
three days in length, became pale and fell insensible to the ground.
Then came violent agitations of the limbs and head, as Voltaire
remarks, &ldquo;quite according to the ancient custom of all nations,
and the rules of madness transmitted from age to age.&rdquo; Finally
the patient (who might be a little child, a woman, a half-witted
person) began to speak in the good French of the Huguenot Bible
words such as these: &ldquo;Mes fr√®res, amendez-vous, faites p√©nitence,
la fin du monde approche; le jugement g√©n√©ral sera dans trois
mois; r√©pentez-vous du grand p√©ch√© que vous avez commis d&rsquo;aller
√† la messe; c&rsquo;est le Saint-Esprit qui parle par ma bouche&rdquo;
(Brueys, <i>Histoire du fanatisme de notre temps</i>, Utrecht, 1737, vol. i.
p. 153). The discourse might go on for two hours; after which
the patient could only express himself in his native patois,&mdash;a
Romance idiom,&mdash;and had no recollection of his &ldquo;ecstasy.&rdquo; All
kinds of miracles attended on the Camisards. Lights in the sky
guided them to places of safety, voices sang encouragement to
them, shots and wounds were often harmless. Those entranced
fell from trees without hurting themselves; they shed tears of
blood; and they subsisted without food or speech for nine days.
The supernatural was part of their life. Much literature has been
devoted to the discussion of these marvels. The Catholics
Fl√©chier (in his <i>Lettres choisies</i>) and Brueys consider them the
product of fasting and vanity, nourished on apocalyptic literature.
The doctors Bertrand (<i>Du magn√©tisme animal</i>, Paris, 1826) and
Calmeil (<i>De la folie</i>, Paris, 1845) speak of magnetism, hysteria
and epilepsy, a prophetic monomania based on belief in divine
possession. The Protestants especially emphasized the spirituality
of the inspiration of the Camisards; Peyral, <i>Histoire des
pasteurs du d√©sert</i>, ii. 280, wrote: &ldquo;Il fallait √† cet effort gigantesque
un ressort prodigieux, l&rsquo;enthousiasme ordinaire n&rsquo;y e√ªt pas
suffi.&rdquo; Dubois, who has made a careful study of the problem, says:
&ldquo;L&rsquo;inspiration c√©venole nous apparait comme un ph√©nom√®ne
purement spirituel.&rdquo; Conservative Catholics, such as Hippolyte
Blanc in his book on <i>L&rsquo;inspiration des Camisards</i> (1859), regard
the whole thing as the work of the devil. The publication
of J.F.K. Hecker&rsquo;s work, <i>Die Volkskrankheiten des Mittelalters</i>,
made it possible to consider the subject in its true relation. This
was translated into English in 1844 by B.G. Babington as <i>The
Epidemics of the Middle Ages</i>.</p>

<p>Although the Camisards were guilty of great cruelties in the
prosecution of the war, there does not seem to be sufficient ground
for the charge made by Marshal de Villars: &ldquo;Le plupart de leurs
chefs ont leurs demoiselles&rdquo; (letter of 9th August 1704, in the
<i>War Archives</i>, vol. 1797). Court replied to these unjust charges:
&ldquo;Their enemies have accused them of leading a life of licence
because there were women in their camps. These were their wives,
their daughters, their mothers, who were there to prepare their
food and to nurse the wounded&rdquo; (<i>Histoire</i>, vol. i. p. 71).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;The works devoted to the history of the Camisards
are very numerous. Nevertheless there exists no work specifically
devoted to this extremely interesting period in French history,
for in none of the published works has proper use been made of the
valuable documents preserved in the archives of the ministry of
war. Among the chief works are:&mdash;P√®re Louvreleuil (priest, former
cur√© of St. Germain de Calberte), <i>Histoire du fanatisme renouvel√© o√π
l&rsquo;on raconte les sacril√®ges, les maladies et les meurtres commis dans
les C√©vennes</i> (Toulouse, 1704); M. de Brueys, <i>Suite de l&rsquo;histoire du
fanatisme de notre temps o√π l&rsquo;on voit les derniers troubles des C√©vennes</i>
(Paris, 1709); <i>Lettres choisies de M. Fl√©chier √©v√™que de N√Æmes avec
une relation des fanatiques du Vivarez</i> (Paris, 1715); Madame de
Merez de l&rsquo;Incarnation, <i>Memoires et journal tr√®s fid√®le de ce qui s&rsquo;est
pass√© le 11 de may 1703 jusqu&rsquo;au 1 juin 1705 √† N√Æmes touchant les
phanatiques</i>, published by E. de Barth√©lemy (Montpellier, 1874).
These works are written by Catholic writers immediately after the
war of the C√©vennes, and, despite their partiality, include some
valuable documents. <i>M√©moires du marquis de Guiscard</i> (Delft, 1705);
Maximilien Misson, <i>Le Th√©√¢tre sacr√© des C√©vennes ou R√©cit de diverses
merveilles nouvellement op√©r√©es dans cette partie de la province de
Languedoc</i> (London, 1707); Misson, the author of the <i>Voyages en
Italie</i>, which met with such a great success, gave prominence to
the facts relating to the inspiration of the Camisards; the <i>Th√©√¢tre</i>
also contains important extracts from the works of Benoit, Brueys,
Guiscard and Boyer, and several original letters from Camisards;
<i>Histoire des Camisards, &amp;c.</i> (London, 1740), the anonymous work of a
distinguished writer, which was eventually condemned by the parlement
of Toulouse to be torn up and burnt in 1759; Antoine Court,
<i>Histoire des troubles des C√©vennes</i> (3 vols., 1760), the best work of
this period, compiled from numerous manuscript references. The war of the
C√©vennes has been treated in several English works, <i>e.g.</i> <i>A Compleat
History of the Cevennes, giving a Particular Account of the Situation,
&amp;c.</i>, by a doctor of civil law (London, 1703). This work includes
a dedication to the queen, an historical account of the people of the
C√©vennes, the bull of Pope Clement against the Camisards, and the
bishop of N√Æmes&rsquo;s mandate publishing the bull, and a discourse on
the obligations of the English to help the Camisards, and a form of
prayer used in the Camisard assembly, printed in London in 1703
under the title <i>Formulaire de pri√®res des C√©vennois dans leurs assembl√©es.
The History of the Rise and Downfal of the Camisards, &amp;c.</i>
(London, 1709), dealt with the prophets of the C√©vennes in London,
and is only an abridged translation of P√®re Louvreleuil&rsquo;s work.
Among modern works are, Ernest Moret, <i>Quinze ans du r√®gne de
Louis XIV</i> (3 vols., 1859), a work which gives a remarkable history
of the war of the C√©vennes; <i>Les Insurg√©s protestants sous Louis XIV.</i>,
studies and unedited documents published by G. Frosterus (1868);
<i>M√©moires de Bonbonnoux,</i> chief Camisard and pastor of the desert,
published by Vielles (1883); Bonnem√®re, <i>Histoire de la guerre des
Camisards</i> (1859). Two popular works are&mdash;F. Puaux, <i>Histoire
populaire de la guerre des Camisards</i> (1875); Anna E. Bray, <i>The
Revolt of the Protestants of the C√©vennes with some Account of the
Huguenots of the Seventeenth Century</i> (London, 1870).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CAMOENS<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Cam&#332;es</span>], <span class="bold">LUIS VAZ DE</span> (1524-1580), the prince
of Portuguese poets, sprang from an illustrious and wealthy
family of Galician origin, whose seat, called the castle of Camoens,
lay near Cape Finisterre. His ancestor, the poet Vasco Pires
de Camoens, followed the party of Peter the Cruel of Castile
against Henry II., and on the defeat of the former had to take
refuge along with other Galician nobles in Portugal, where he
founded the Portuguese family of his name. King Fernando
received him well, and gave him posts of honour and estates,
and though the master of Aviz sequestered some of these and
Vasco lost others after the battle of Aljubarrota, where he
fought on the Spanish side, considerable possessions still remained
to him. Ant√£o Vaz, the grandfather of Luis, married one of the
Algarve Gamas, so that Vasco da Gama and Camoens, the discoverer
of the sea route to India and the poet who immortalized
the voyage in his <i>Lusiads</i>, were kinsmen. Ant√£o&rsquo;s eldest son
Sim√£o Vaz was born in Coimbra at the close of the 15th century,
and married Anna de S√° e Macedo, who bore him an only son,
Luis Vaz de Camoens; thus the poet, like his father and grandfather,
was a <i>cavalleiro fidalgo</i>, that is, an untitled noble.</p>

<p>Four cities dispute the honour of being his birthplace, though
Lisbon has the better title; and there is a like dispute about
the year, which, however, was almost certainly 1524. The poet
spent his childhood in Coimbra, where his father owned a property,
and made his first studies at the college of All Saints,
designed for &ldquo;honourable poor students,&rdquo; and there contracted
friendships with noblemen like D. Gon√ßalo da Silveira and his
brother D. Alvaro, who were inmates of the nobles&rsquo; college of
St Michael. These colleges were offshoots from and attached to
the Augustinian monastery of Santa Cruz, an important religious
and scholastic establishment, where the poet&rsquo;s uncle D. Bento
de Camoens, a virtuous and very learned man, was professed.
The Renaissance, though late in penetrating into Portugal, had
by this time definitely triumphed, and the university of Coimbra,
after its reform in 1537 under the auspices of King John III.,
boasted the best teachers drawn from every country, among
them George Buchanan. The possession of classical culture
was regarded as the mark of a gentleman; the colleges of Santa
Cruz required conversation within the walls to be in Greek or
Latin, and the university, when it absorbed the colleges, adopted
the same rule. In these surroundings, aided by a retentive
memory, Camoens steeped himself in the literature and mythology
of the ancients, as his works show, and he was thus able in
after years to perfect the Portuguese language and to enrich it
with many neologisms of classical origin. It is fortunate, however,
for his country and his fame that he never followed the fashion
of writing in Latin; on the contrary, except for his Spanish
poems, he always employed his native tongue. After completing
his grammar and rhetoric the poet entered on his university
course for the degree of bachelor of arts, which lasted for three
years, from 1539 to 1542, and during this period he met Jorge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
de Montemayor, the author of <i>Dian√°</i>, who was then studying
music. He seems to have imbibed much of that encyclopaedic
instruction to which the humanists aspired, for his writings show
a very extensive reading, and his scientific knowledge and faculty
of observation compelled the admiration of the great Humboldt.
The thoroughness of his teaching is apparent when we remember
that he wrote his epic in the fortresses of Africa and Asia, far
from books, and yet gave proof of acquaintance with universal
history, geography, astronomy, Greek and Latin literature, and
the modern poetry of Italy and Spain. Much of the credit for this
learning must be attributed to the encouragement of D. Bento,
now prior of Santa Cruz, who became chancellor of the university
the very year when Camoens entered it. There is a tradition
that this uncle destined him for the church and caused him to
study theology. The poet&rsquo;s knowledge of dogma and the Bible,
his friendly intercourse with the Lisbon Dominicans at the end of
his life, and the share he is said to have taken in their
disputations, make the hypothesis a likely one, but he made his own
choice and preferred a lay life. We have very little verse of his
Coimbra time, but it seems that he began in the Italian manner,
following the new classical school of S√° de Miranda (<i>q.v.</i>), and that,
though attached to the popular muse and well acquainted with
the national songs and romances, legends and lore, his poetry
in the old style (<i>medida velha</i>) is mostly of later date. An
exception may perhaps be found in his <i>Auto</i> after the manner
of Gil Vicente (<i>q.v.</i>), <i>The Amphitryons</i>, a Portuguese adaptation
from Plautus which was very well received. At the age of
eighteen Camoens left Coimbra, bidding adieu to the old city
in verses breathing the most tender <i>saudade</i>. Lisbon, which
impressed Cervantes so much as to draw from him a classic
description in the novel <i>Persiles y Sigismunda</i>, made an even
greater impression on the youthful Camoens, and the <i>Lusiads</i>
are full of eulogistic epithets on the city and the Tagus.</p>

<p>Arriving in 1543, it has been conjectured that he became
tutor to D. Antonio de Noronha, son of the great noble D.
Francisco de Noronha, count of Linhares, who had lately returned
from a French embassy to his palace at Xabregas. The poet&rsquo;s
birth and talents admitted him to the society of men like D.
Constantine de Braganza, the duke of Aveiro, the marquis of
Cascaes, the count of Redondo, D. Manoel de Portugal and
D. Gon√ßalo da Silveira, son of the count of Sortelha, who died
a Christian martyr in Monomotapa. At Xabregas Camoens
must have met Francisco de Moraes (<i>q.v.</i>), who had served as
secretary to the count of Linhares on his embassy, and there
he probably read the MS. of <i>Palmeirim</i>; this would explain the
origin of two of his roundels which are clearly founded on
passages in the romance. Camoens had had a youthful love
affair in Coimbra, but on Good Friday of the year 1544 he
experienced the passion of his life. On that day in some Lisbon
church he caught sight of D. Catherina de Ataide (daughter of
D. Antonio de Lima, high chamberlain to the infant D. Duarte),
who had recently become a lady-in-waiting to the queen. This
young girl, the Nathercia of his after songs, counted then some
thirteen years, and was destined to be his Beatrice. To see more
of her, he persuaded the count of Linhares to introduce him to
the court, where his poetical gifts and culture ensured him a
ready welcome, and his fifth idyll, addressed to his patron on
this occasion, paved the way for his entrance. Though inferior
to his later compositions, it excels in harmony any verse
previously written in Portuguese. At first his suit probably met
with few difficulties, and if Catherina&rsquo;s family regarded it
seriously, their poverty, combined with the fact that the poet
came of a good stock and had the future in his hands, may have
prevented any real opposition. It was his own imprudence that
marred his fortunes, and his consciousness of this fact gave his
muse that moving expression, truth and <i>saudade</i>, which are
lacking in the somewhat artificial productions of the sentimental
Petrarch. But while Camoens gained protectors and admirers,
his temperament and conduct ensured him envious foes, and the
secret of his love got out and became the subject of gossip. All
was not smooth with the lady, who showed herself coy; now
yielding to her heart, she was kind; and then listening to her
friends, who would have preferred a better match for her, she
repelled her lover. Jealousy then seized him, and sick of court
life for the moment, he gladly accompanied his patron to the
latter&rsquo;s country house; but once there he recognized that
Lisbon was the centre of attraction for him and that he could
not be happy at a distance. His verses at this time reveal his
parlous condition. He oscillates between joy and depression.
He passes from tender regrets to violent outbursts, which are
followed by calm and peace, while expressions of passionate love
alternate with bold desires and lofty ambitions. It is clear
that there was an understanding between him and Catherina and
that they looked forward to a happy ending, and this encouraged
him in his weary waiting and his search for a lucrative post
which would enable him to approach her family and ask for her
hand. From this period date the greater part of his roundels and
sonnets, some of the odes and nearly all the eclogues.</p>

<p>His fifth eclogue shows that he was seriously thinking of his
patriotic poem in 1544; and from the fourth it seems likely
that the <i>Lusiads</i> were in course of composition, and that
cantos 3 and 4 were practically completed. He had by now established
his fame and was known as the Lusitanian Virgil, but presently
he had a rude awakening from his dreams of love and glory.
He had shown his affection too openly, and some infraction of
court etiquette, about which the queen was strict, caused the
tongue of scandal to wag; perhaps it was an affair with one of
Catherina&rsquo;s brothers, even a duel, that led to the decree which
exiled him from Lisbon.</p>

<p>Camoens&rsquo;s rashness, self-confidence and want of respect for
the authorities all contributed to the penalty, and the composition
of the play <i>El Rei Seleuco</i> would aggravate his offence in the
eyes of John III. Produced in 1545 and derived from Plutarch,
the plot was calculated to draw attention to the relations between
the king and his stepmother, and to recall the action of D. Manoel
in robbing his son John III. of his intended bride. Camoens
composed it for a wedding festivity in the house of Estacio da
Fonseca, and some of the verses refer so openly to his passion,
that if, as is likely, he spoke them himself, emphasizing them
with voice and gesture so as to publish his love to the world, this
new boldness, combined with the subject of the piece, must have
rendered his exile a certainty. All we know definitely, however,
is that the court was henceforth closed to him, and in 1546 he
had to leave Lisbon, the abode of his love and the scene of his
triumph. Tradition says that he went to the Ribatejo and
spent seven or eight months with his mother&rsquo;s relatives in or
near Santarem, whence he poured out a number of his finest
poems, including his <i>Elegy of Exile</i> and some magnificent
sonnets, which, in vigour of ideas and beauty of expression,
exceeded anything he had hitherto produced. Poets cannot live
on bays, however, and pressed by necessity he determined to
become a soldier.</p>

<p>One of his best modern biographers thinks that he petitioned
the king for liberty to commute his penalty into military service
in Africa; but whether this be so, or whether he merely went
there to gain his spurs, certain it is that in the autumn of 1547
he proceeded to Ceuta. For the next two years, the usual period of
service there, he lived the routine life of a common soldier in
this famous trade emporium and outpost-town, and he lost his
right eye in a skirmish with the Moroccans, though some writers
make the incident occur on the voyage across the straits when
his ship was attacked by Sallee rovers. Elegy ii. and a couple
of odes date from his stay in Ceuta. He is full of sadness and
almost in despair, but is saved from suicide by love and memory
of the past. He has intervals of calm and resignation, even of
satirical humour, and these become more frequent as the term of
his exile draws near, and in one of them he wrote his prose
letter to a &ldquo;Lisbon friend.&rdquo; The octaves on the <i>Discontent of the
World</i>, which breathe a philosophic equanimity and lift the reader
out of the tumult of daily life, go to show that his restless heart
had found peace at last and that he had accustomed himself to solitude.</p>

<p>In November 1549 the aged governor of Ceuta, D. Affonso de
Noronha, was summoned to court and created viceroy of India,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
and Camoens accompanied him to Lisbon, intending to follow him
to the East in the armada which was due to sail in the spring of
1550. Reaching the capital in December, the poet almost
immediately enlisted, but when the time came for departure he
had changed his mind. His affection for Catherina and dreams
of literary glory detained him, and he lived on in the expectation
of obtaining a post on the strength of his services and wound.
But month after month passed by without result, and in his
disappointment he allied himself with a group of hot-blooded
youths, including the ex-friar Antonio Ribeiro, nicknamed
&ldquo;the Chiado&rdquo;, after whom the main street of Lisbon takes its
name, and endeavoured to forget his troubles in their society.
He took part in their extravagances and gained the name of
&ldquo;Trinca-fortes&rdquo; (&ldquo;Crack-braves&rdquo;) from his bohemian companions,
while there were ladies who mocked at his disfigurement,
dubbing him &ldquo;devil&rdquo; and &ldquo;eyeless face&rdquo;. In the course of his
adventures he had often to draw his sword, either as attacker or
attacked, and he boasted that he had seen the soles of the feet of
many but none had seen his. When the reply to his application
came from the palace it was a negative one, and he had now
nothing further to expect. His stock of money brought from
Ceuta was certainly exhausted, and misery stared him in the face,
making him desperate. On the feast of Corpus Christi, the 16th
of June 1552, he found two masked friends of his engaged in a
street fight near St Dominic&rsquo;s convent, and joining in the fray he
wounded one Gon√ßalo Borges, a palace servant, with the result
that he was apprehended and lodged in gaol. This unprovoked
attack upon a royal servant on so holy a day constituted a serious
offence and cost him eight months&rsquo; imprisonment. In a pathetic
sonnet he describes his terrible experiences, which made such an
impression on him that years afterwards he recurred to them in
his great autobiographical Canzon 10. When Borges&rsquo; wound was
completely healed, the poet&rsquo;s friends intervened to assist him,
and it was arranged that on his formally imploring pardon
Borges should grant it and desist from proceeding with the case.
This was effected on the 13th of February 1553, and on the 7th
of March the king, taking into consideration that Camoens was
&ldquo;a youth and poor and decided to serve this year in India&rdquo;,
confirmed the pardon. He had been obliged to humble his pride
and enlist again, but while he complained of his troubles he
recognized, in his frank, honest way, that his own mistakes were
in part the causes of them.</p>

<p>After bidding good-bye to Catherina for the last time, Camoens
set sail on Palm Sunday, the 24th of March 1553, in the &ldquo;S.
Bento&rdquo;, the flagship of a fleet of four vessels, under Ferna√µ
Alvares Cabral. His last words, he says in a letter, were those of
Scipio Africanus, &ldquo;Ingrata patria, non possidebis ossa mea&rdquo;.</p>

<p>He relates some of his experiences on board and the events
of the voyage in various sonnets in Elegy iii. and in the <i>Lusiads</i>.
In those days the sailors navigated the ships, while the men-at-arms
kept the day and night watches, helped in the cleaning and,
in case of necessity, at the pumps, but the rank of Camoens
doubtless saved him from manual work. He had much time to
himself in his six months&rsquo; voyage and was able to lay in a store of
nautical knowledge, while tempestuous weather off the Cape of
Good Hope led him to conceive the dramatic episode of Adamastor
(<i>Lusiads</i>, canto 5). The &ldquo;S. Bento&rdquo;, the best ship of the fleet,
weathered the Cape safely, and without touching at Mozambique,
the watering-place of ships bound for India, anchored at Goa in
September. It seems probable that the idea of the <i>Lusiads</i>
took further shape on the voyage out, and that Camoens modified
his plan; cantos 3 and 4 were already written, but from an
historical he now made it a maritime epic. The discovery of
India became the main theme, while the history of Portugal was
interlaced with it, and the poem ended with the espousals
between Portugal and the ocean, and a prophecy of the future
greatness of the fatherland.</p>

<p>At the time of his arrival Goa boasted 100,000 inhabitants,
and with its magnificent harbour was the commercial capital of
the west of India. The first viceroy had been content with a sea
dominion, but the great Affonso de Albuquerque saw that this
was not enough to secure the supremacy of the Portuguese;
recognizing the strategic value of Goa, he seized it and made it
the capital of a land empire, and built fortresses in every important
point through the East. Since his death a succession of remarkable
victories had made the flag of Portugal predominant, but
the enervating climate, the pleasures and the plunder of Asia,
began to tell on the conquerors. Corruption was rife from the
governor downwards, because the ruling ambition was to get
rich and return home, and the hero of one day was a pirate the
next. After all, it was only human nature, for a governorship
lasted but three years and Portugal was far away, so the saying
went round&mdash;&ldquo;They are installed the first year, they rob the
second, and then pack up in the third to sail away.&rdquo; Camoens
was well received at first, owing to his talents and bravery, and
he found the life cheap and merry, but having left his country
with high ideals, the injustice and demoralization of manners
he found in India soon disgusted him. He compared Goa to
Babylon, and called it &ldquo;the mother of villains and the stepmother
of honest men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His first military service in the East took place in November
1553, when he went with a force led by the viceroy to chastise a
petty king on the Malabar coast. The expedition only lasted
two or three months, and after some trivial combats it returned
to Goa. In February of the following year Camoens accompanied
the viceroy&rsquo;s son, D. Fernando de Menezes, who led an
armada to the mouth of the Red Sea and thence up the Arabian
coast to snap up hostile merchantmen and suppress piracy.
Next the fleet went on to Ormuz, as was the custom with these
annual cruises, and then to Bassora, where the poet helped to
make some valuable prizes, and wrote a sonnet&mdash;it was ever,
with him, &ldquo;in one hand the sword, in the other the pen&rdquo;!
Returning to Goa in November he learnt of the deaths of Prince
John, and of his friend and pupil the young D. Antonio de
Noronha, and paid his tribute in a feeling sonnet and eclogue.
In February 1555 he sailed on another pirate hunt and spent
six weary months off Cape Guardafui, varied by a visit to
Mombasa and by further work on his epic, and only got back to
Goa in the following September. His experiences are recorded
in the profound and sad 10th Canzon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Francisco Barreto, an honourable and generous
man, had become governor-general of India in the June of 1555,
and, his appointment being popular, a reign of festivities began
in Golden Goa to welcome his succession, in the course of which
Camoens produced his <i>Filodemo</i>, a dramatized novel written in
his court days. The same occasion probably gave birth to the
<i>Disparates na India</i> (&ldquo;Follies of India&rdquo;), and certainly to the
<i>Satyra do Torneio</i> (&ldquo;Satire of the Tourney&rdquo;), which confirmed
the poet&rsquo;s reputation as a sayer of sharp things and gave
considerable umbrage to those whom the cap fitted. However, it
was not the enmities thus aroused but military duty which
compelled him to quit Goa once more in the spring of 1556. He
had enlisted in Lisbon for five years, the usual term, and in
compliance with the orders of the governor he sailed for the
Moluccas in April and there fought and versified for two years,
though nearly all is guesswork at this period of his life. He
appears to have spent the time between September 1556 and
February 1557 in the island of Ternate, where he wrote Canzon
6, revealing a state of moral depression similar to that of
Canzon 10, and he perhaps visited Banda and Amboina. In the
following year he took part in the military occupation of Macao,
which the emperor of China had presented to the Portuguese in
return for their destruction of a pirate fleet which had besieged
Canton. The poet&rsquo;s five years&rsquo; term of service was now over,
and he remained at Macao many months waiting for a ship to
carry him back to India. He had made some profit out of the
<i>Merc√Æ de Viagem</i>, granted by the governor Barreto to free him
from the poverty in which he habitually lived, and he spent his
money royally. At the same time he continued his epic, working
in the grotto which still bears his name.</p>

<p>All seemed to be going smoothly with him until suddenly his
fortunes took a serious turn for the worse. As the result of an
intrigue the captain of the yearly ship from China to India, who
acted as governor of Macao during his stay in port, imprisoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span>
Camoens, and took him on board with a view of bringing him to
trial in India. The ship, however, was wrecked in October 1559
at the mouth of the Mekong river, and the poet had to save his
life and his <i>Lusiads</i> by swimming to shore, and though he
preserved the six or seven finished cantos of the poem, he lost
everything else. While wandering about on the Cambodian
coast awaiting the monsoon and a vessel to take him to Malacca,
he composed those magnificent stanzas &ldquo;By the Waters of
Babylon,&rdquo; called by Lope de Vega &ldquo;the pearl of all poetry,&rdquo;
in which he recalls the happy days of his youth, sighs for Lisbon
(Sion) and his love, and mourns his long exile from home. He
got somehow to Malacca, and after a short stay there reached
Goa, still as prisoner, in June 1561. He was straightway lodged
in gaol, where he heard for the first time of the death of Catherina,
and he poured out his grief in the great sonnet, <i>Alma Minha
Gentil</i>. The viceroy, D. Constantius de Bragan√ßa, had recently
returned from Jafanapatam, bringing as prize a tooth of Buddha,
and Camoens approached him with a splendid epistle in twenty
octaves, after the manner of Horace&rsquo;s ode to Augustus. It
failed, however, to hasten the consideration of his case, but
in September the Conde de Redondo, a good friend, came into
office and immediately ordered his release from prison. His
troubles were not yet at an end, however, for one Miguel
Rodriguez Coutinho, a well-known soldier and citizen of Goa
who lent money at usurious rates, thought the opportunity a
good one to obtain repayment of a debt, and had Camoens
lodged once more in gaol. As soon as he came out the poet
composed a burlesque roundel satirizing his persecutor under the
nickname of Fios Seccos (&ldquo;dry threads&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Though very poor he now led an easier, even a pleasant life
for a time. He was able to see his friends D. Vasco de Ataide,
D. Francisco de Almeida, Heitor da Silveira, Jo√£o Lopes Leita√µ
and Francisco de Mello, all men of family and note. One day he
invited them to a banquet, at which, instead of the usual dishes,
each guest was served with a set of witty verses, and after these
had been read out and chaff had gone round, the food came and
they formed a merry party. The poet used his interest with the
viceroy to recommend to him the naturalist Garcia da Orta, whose
<i>Colloquies</i> on the simples and drugs of the East, the first
product of the press in India, appeared in April 1563 with an
ode by Camoens. His life for the next three years is almost a
blank, but we know that he was hard at work finishing his epic,
assisted by the advice of the historian Diogo do Couto, who
became its commentator, and further that the new viceroy, his
friend D. Ant√£o de Noronha, nominated him to a reversion of
the factory of Chaul, which, however, never fell into possession.
It is clear from his writings that fourteen years in the East had
told on Camoens. His best friends were dead or scattered, and
he was overwhelmed with <i>saudade</i>. His sole ambition was
to go home and print his poem, but he had no money to pay his
passage. In September 1567, however, Pedro Barreto was named
captain of Mozambique, and insisted on the poet accompanying
him to Sofala, at the same time lending him two hundred
cruzades. It was part of the way home, so Camoens accepted,
but after they reached Mozambique Barreto called in this money,
and his debtor, being unable to pay, was detained there for two
whole years. Here Diogo do Couto found him &ldquo;so poor that he
ate at the cost of friends, and in order that he might embark for
the Kingdom we friends collected for him the clothes he needed
and some gave him to eat, and that winter he finished perfecting
the <i>Lusiads</i> for the press and wrote much in a book he was
making, which he called <i>Parnaso of Luiz de Camoes</i>, a book of
much learning, doctrine and philosophy, which was stolen from
him.&rdquo; Thanks to Couto and others, Camoens was able to
liquidate his debt and set sail in November 1569 in the &ldquo;Santa
Clara,&rdquo; and he reached Portugal on the 7th of April 1570, after
an absence of seventeen years.</p>

<p>The only wealth he brought with him from India was the MS.
of his great poem, a <i>&rdquo;Tesoro del Luso&rdquo;</i> in the words of Cervantes.
Moreover, he returned at an unfortunate moment&mdash;one of pest
and famine. The great plague which had killed a quarter, or, as
some say, half of the population of the capital, was declining,
but a rigid quarantine prevailed, and the ship had to lie off
Cascaes until the sanitary authorities allowed her to enter the
Tagus. Camoens was welcomed by his mother, whom he found
&ldquo;very old and very poor&rdquo;&mdash;his father had died at Goa about
1555&mdash;and after a visit to Catherina&rsquo;s tomb, which inspired the
poignant sonnet 337, he set about obtaining the royal licence
to print the <i>Lusiads</i>. This was dated the 24th of September
1571 and gave him a ten years&rsquo; copyright, and as soon as the
book appeared some friendly and influential hand, perhaps D.
Manoel de Portugal, perhaps D. Francisca de Arag√£o for whom
he had rhymed in the happy days of his youth, presented the
national epic to King Sebastian. Shortly afterwards, on the
28th of July 1572, the king gave the poet a pension of fifteen
milreis for the term of three years, as a reward for his services
in India and for his poem. It was relatively a considerable sum,
seeing that he had no great military record, and it seems even
generous when we remember that Magellan had only received
twelve, and had left Portugal because King Manoel would not
give him a slight increase. Many functionaries with families
had less to live on, and Camoens&rsquo;s subsistence was secure for the
time being, and he could afford an attendant, so that the legend
of the slave Antonio may well be true. Moreover, he was in the
enjoyment of the fame his poem brought him. Philip II. is
said to have read and admired it, and the powerful minister,
Pedro de Alca√ßova Carneiro, echoed the general opinion when
he remarked that it had only one defect, in not being short
enough to learn by heart or long enough to have no ending.
Tributes came from abroad too. Tasso wrote and sent Camoens
a sonnet in his praise, Fernando de Herrera celebrated him, and
the year 1580 saw the publication of two Spanish versions, one
at Alcal√°, the other at Salamanca. His pension lapsed in 1575,
but on the 2nd of August it was renewed for a further term;
owing, however, to a mistake of the treasury officials, Camoens
drew nothing for about a year and a half and fell into dire distress.
This explains the story of Ruy da Camara, who had engaged him
to translate the penitential psalms, and not receiving the version,
called on the poet, who said in excuse that he had no spirit
for such work now that he wanted for everything, and that
his slave had asked him for a penny for fuel and he could not
give it.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of June 1578, just before his start for the expedition
to Africa which cost him his life and Portugal her independence,
King Sebastian had renewed the poet&rsquo;s pension for a further
period. Though Camoens had neither the health nor the means
to accompany the splendid train of nobles and courtiers who
followed the last crusading monarch to his doom, he began an
epic to celebrate the enterprise, but burnt it when he heard the
news of the battle of Alcacer. Instead, he mourned the death
of his royal benefactor in a magnificent sonnet, and in Elegy x.
reproached the cowardly soldiery who contributed to the rout.
On the 31st of January 1580 the cardinal king Henry died, and,
foreseeing the Spanish invasion, Camoens wrote in March to his
old friend D. Francisco de Almeida: &ldquo;All will see that I so loved
my country that I was content not only to die in her but with her.&rdquo;
A great plague had been raging in Lisbon since the previous year,
and the poet, who lay ill in his poor cottage in the rua de Santa
Anna, depressed by the calamities of his country, fell a victim
to it. He was removed to a hospital and there passed away,
unmarried and the last of his line, on the 10th of June 1580.
A Carmelite, Frei Jos√© Indio, attended him in his last moments
and received the only recognition Camoens could give, his copy
of the <i>Lusiads</i>. He wrote afterwards: &ldquo;What more grievous
thing than to see so great a genius thus unfortunate. I saw him
die in a hospital in Lisbon, without a sheet to cover him, after
having triumphed in the East Indies and sailed 5000 leagues
by sea.&rdquo; The house of Vimioso supplied the winding-sheet, and
Camoens was buried with other victims of the plague in a common
grave in the cemetery of Santa Anna. Years later D. Gon√ßalo
Coutinho erected in the church of that invocation an <i>in memoriam</i>
slab of marble with an inscription, and subsequently epitaphs
were added by other admirers, but the earthquake of 1755
damaged the building, and all traces of these last acts of homage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
to genius have disappeared. The third centenary of the poet&rsquo;s
death was made the occasion of a national apotheosis, and on the
8th of June 1880 some remains, piously believed to be his, were
borne with those of Vasco da Gama to the national pantheon,
the Jeronymos at Belem.</p>

<p>The masterpiece of Camoens, the <i>Lusiads</i>, is the <i>epos</i> of
discovery. It is written in  hendecasyllabic  <i>ottava rima</i>, and is
divided into ten cantos containing in all 1102 stanzas. Its argument
is briefly as follows. After an exordium proposing the subject,
invoking the Tagus muses and addressing King Sebastian,
Vasco da Gama&rsquo;s ships are shown sailing up the East African
coast on their way to India. At a council of the gods the fate
of the fleet is discussed, and Bacchus promises to thwart the
voyage, while Venus and Mars favour the navigators. They
arrive at Mozambique, where the governor endeavours to destroy
them by stratagem, and, this failing, Bacchus tries other plots
against them at Quiloa and Mombasa which are foiled by Venus.
In answer to her appeal, Jupiter foretells the glorious feats of
the Portuguese in the East, and sends Mercury to direct the
voyagers to Melinde, where they are hospitably received and get
a pilot to guide them to India. The local ruler visits the fleet
and asks Gama about his country and its history, and in response
the latter gives an account of the origin of  the kingdom of
Portugal, its kings and principal achievements, ending with the
incidents of the voyage out. This recital occupies cantos 3,
4 and 5, and includes some of the most admired and most powerful
episodes in the poem, <i>e.g.</i> those of Ignez de Castro, King
Manoel&rsquo;s dream of the rivers Ganges and Indus, the speech of
the old man of Belem and the apparition of Adamastor off the
Cape of Good Hope. Canto 6 describes the crossing of the Indian
Ocean from Melinde to Calicut and a fresh hostile attempt on the
part of Bacchus. He descends to Neptune&rsquo;s palace, and at a
council of the sea-gods it is resolved to order Aeolus to loose the
winds against the Portuguese, but the tempest is quelled by Venus
and her nymphs in answer to Gama&rsquo;s prayer, and the morning
light reveals the Ghats of India. Just before the storm, occurs
the night scene in which Velloso entertains his shipmates with
the story of the Twelve of England, another of  the famous
episodes. Canto 7 is taken up with the arrival at Calicut, a
description of the country and the details of Gama&rsquo;s reception
by the raja. The governor of the city visits the fleet and
inquires about the pictures on their banners, whereupon Paulo
da Gama, Vasco&rsquo;s brother, tells him of the deeds of the early
Portuguese kings. Meanwhile Bacchus, not to be baulked, appears
to a priest in the guise of Mahomet, and stirs up the Moslems
against the Christian adventurers, with the result that the raja
charges Gama with being a leader of convicts and pirates. To
this the captain makes a spirited reply and gets his despatch,
but he has new snares to avoid and further difficulties to overcome
before he is finally able to set sail on the return voyage.
Pitying their toils, Venus determines to give the voyagers repose
and pleasure on their way home, and directs their course to an
enchanted island, which is described in canto 9, in the longest
and perhaps the most beautiful episode in the poem. On landing
they are received by the goddess and her nymphs, and general
joy ensues, heightened by banquets and amorous play. In a
prophetic song, the siren tells of the exploits of the Portuguese
viceroys, governors and captains in India until the time of
D John de Castro, after which Tethys ascends a mountain with
Gama, shows him the spheres after the system of Ptolemy and
the globe of Asia and Africa, and describes the Indian life of
St Thomas the apostle. Finally the navigators quit the island
and reach Lisbon, and an epilogue contains a patriotic
exhortation to King Sebastian and visions of glory, which
ended so disastrously at the battle of Alcacer.</p>

<p>Though the influence of Camoens on Portuguese has been
exaggerated, it was very considerable, and he so far fixed the
written language that at the present day it is commonly and not
inaccurately called &ldquo;the language of Camoens.&rdquo; The <i>Lusiads</i>
is the most successful modern epic cast in the ancient mould, and
it has done much to preserve the corporate life of the Portuguese
people and to keep alive the spirit of nationality in times
of adversity like the &ldquo;Spanish Captivity&rdquo; and the Napoleonic
invasion. Even now it forms a powerful bond between the
mother-country and her potentially mighty daughter-nation
across the Atlantic, the United States of Brazil. The men of
the Renaissance saw nothing incongruous in that mixture of
paganism and Christianity which is found in the <i>Lusiads</i> as in
Ariosto, though some modern critics, like Voltaire, consider it a
grave artistic defect in the poem. The fact that the <i>Lusiads</i>
is written in a little-known language, and its intensely national
and almost exclusively historical character, undoubtedly militate
against a right estimate of its value, now that Portugal, once a
world power, has long ceased to hold the East in fee or to guide
the destinies of Europe. But though political changes may and
do react on literary appreciations, the <i>Lusiads</i> remains none
the less a great poem, breathing the purest religious fervour,
love of country and spirit of chivalry, with splendid imaginative
and descriptive passages full of the truest and deepest poetry.
The structure is Virgilian, but the whole conception is the
author&rsquo;s own, while the style is natural and noble, the diction
nearly always correct and elegant, and the verse, as a rule,
sonorous and full of harmony.</p>

<p>In addition to his epic, Camoens wrote sonnets, canzons, odes,
sextines, eclogues, elegies, octaves, roundels, letters and comedies.
The roundels include <i>cartas, motes, voltas, cantigas, trovas,
pastorals</i> and <i>endechas</i>. In the opinion of many competent
judges Camoens only attains his true stature in his lyrics; and
a score of his sonnets, two or three of the canzons, eclogues and
elegies, and the Babylonian roundels will bear comparison with
any composition of the same kind that other literatures can show.
Referring to the <i>Lusiads</i>, A. von Humboldt calls Camoens a
&ldquo;great maritime painter,&rdquo; but in his best lyrics he is a thinker
as well as a poet, and when free from the trammels of the epic
and inherited respect for classical traditions, he reveals a
personality so virile and deep, a philosophy so broad and human, a
vision so wide, and a form and style so nearly perfect, as not only
to make him the foremost of Peninsular bards but to entitle him to
a place in that small company of universal poets of the first rank.</p>

<p>The oldest and most authentic portrait of Camoens appeared
in 1624 with his life, by Manoel Severim de Faria. It is a kitcat
and shows the poet in armour wearing a laurel crown; his right
hand holds a pen, his left rests on a copy of the <i>Lusiads</i>, while
a shield above shows the family arms, a dragon rising from between
rocks. The likeness exhibits a Gothic or northern type, and the
tradition of his red beard and blue eyes confirms it. Except for
an ode, sonnet and elegy, all Camoens&rsquo;s lyrics were published
posthumously.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;The most modern and most critical biographies are
those of Dr Theophilo Braga, <i>Cam√µes, epoca e Vide</i> (Oporto, 1907),
and of Dr Wilhelm Storck, <i>Luis de Cam√µes Leben</i> (Paderborn, 1890),
while the most satisfactory edition of the complete works is
due to the Visconde de Juromenha (6 vols., Lisbon, 1860-1869),
though it contains some spurious matter. While rejecting without
good reason many of the traditions accepted by Juromenha in his
life of the poet, Storck embroiders on his own account, and Braga
must be preferred to him. Two volumes of Innocencio da Silva&rsquo;s
<i>Diccionario Bibliographico Portuguez</i> (14 and 15) are entirely
devoted to Camoens and Camoniana, the second of them dealing fully
with the tercentenary celebrations. Among modern Portuguese studies
of the national epic the most important are perhaps <i>Cam√µes e a
Renascen√ßa em Portugal</i>, by Oliveira Martins, and <i>Cam√µes e o
Sentimento Nacional</i>, by Dr T. Braga (Oporto, 1891). The latter
volume contains useful information on the various editions of Camoens,
with an account of the texts and remarks on his plagiarists. Very
few poets have been so often translated, and a list and estimate of
the English translations of the <i>Lusiads</i> from the time of Sir
Richard Fanshawe (1655) downwards, will be found in Sir Richard Burton&rsquo;s
<i>Camoens: His Life and His Lusiads</i>, which, notwithstanding some
errors, is a most informing book, and the result of a curious
similarity of temperament and experience between master and disciple.
Burton translated the <i>Lusiads</i> (2 vols., London, 1880) and the
<i>Lyricks</i> (sonnets, canzons, odes and sextines; 2 vols., London,
1884), and left a version of all the minor works in MS. The accurate
and readable version of the epic by Mr J.J. Aubertin, with the
Portuguese text opposite, has gone through two editions (2nd ed.,
2 vols., London, 1884), and there is a version of seventy of the
sonnets, accompanied by the Portuguese text, by the same author
(London, 1881).</p>
